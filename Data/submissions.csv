Don't base things on just the ""looks"" of one  chart. Use a little more data than that.  I see too many people just looking at a couple spikes and dips; and jump to a conclusion just because saw a few similar spikes and dips.   Newsflash: any chart you'll find will be made up of tons of peaks and throughs to pick from.  It's down to how psychologically flexible you are to decide if there's enough of a similarity.   Here's an example of how comparing the current chart of the SP500 can give you both bearish and bullish prediction; if you keep it simple and vague:  #x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/co504uhob3x81.jpg?width=960format=pjpgauto=webps=85e53d01c713349db34346f28c4233e8e60b3156  I can find the same pattern in 2008; right now; or right before a bull run. Of course; the actual market conditions were very different in all cases.    This was taken from a post here a few days ago; comparing us to 2008:  #x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/tznr1ybzb3x81.jpg?width=662format=pjpgauto=webps=417b7fb44e052736cccd47b5248b4f2ef380b7a5  Presented like that; it looks like we're obviously in 2008 2.0 right?  But people back in that first 1234 pattern from 2 years ago; probably also thought this might be 2008 repeating itself. But instead it went on a bull run.   You can make the case that liquidity got pumped in to rescue the market from going into 2008 mode; so it's not the same.  But you can also make the case that 2008 didn't have the same conditions we have now; so it's not the same either.   We have Fed rate hikes and a war; with different dynamics than the 2008 house market fiasco imploding. You can even make the case that it's really the extra liquidity being switched off by the Fed that's causing an expected correction as things are going back to normal without that extra gift to the stock market.   In either case; a single chart isn't gonna tell you any of that.   Much less only a few vague data points.   You need a lot more out of a chart before jumping to conclusions. Charts are very easy to use to confirm a bias. Especially without enough context. Especially without enough data.  There's also a little more than charts. There's plenty of other data out there that won't give you those misleading impressions on just looks. There's also statistical analysis; which is much more useful; just not as pretty.   The latest example:  #x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/if9val0rh3x81.jpg?width=720format=pjpgauto=webps=d89b93fdeb6f5f38cb1bfc66631ef450edcef245  This is my latest favorite chart that can easily create confirmation bias. There's very little context; much less perspective.    And of course; based on where we are in the time line; it makes it look more dramatic than it actually is. If you move back the timeline; to 2008; it would also look like an exponential Goliath dwarfing everything else.   This is not to say the chart is incorrect.  The data is correct. But it's easy to make it a little misleading; and overdramatize a narrative. Especially for people who don't have enough of the context. Or other data to compare.",17,36
