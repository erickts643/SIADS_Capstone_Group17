# SIADS_Capstone_Group17

Welcome to the SIADS_Capstone_Group17 wiki!

# Introduction
Our project examines the phenomenon of short squeezes in the stock market.  The main datasets of archived stock options chain data and Reddit WallStreetBets forum text were supplemented by public APIs Yahoo Finance, scraped data from Zacks.com, and imported data from Nasdaq. 

# Running the Code

## Requirements
Requirements.txt file includes all the libaries required to run our code.

## Jupyter Notebooks
Our code is found in the Jupyter_Notebooks folder of this repository.  If you have all the required libraries in the Requirements.txt file, you should be able to run the notebooks freely.

Note: Some of our notebooks connect with our database hosted on the AWS environment.  As per the given specifications for this Repo, we have removed the user login credentials to the AWS environment.  Please reach out to us if necessary.

# Final Outputs
The content for our final paper was produced in our Jupyter notebooks found in this repo. They depict our coding process that generated visualizations and insights.  Those outputs and the methodology involved are discussed in our final paper as well as used in our final dashboard.
