If they cannot find a favorable rate from another bank (perhaps as the Fed has forecasted continued rate hikes); then they borrow from the Fed at its current target rate. The amount of cash reserves on hand is not really relevant; as the solvency issues more pertain to the post-Glass-Stegall gambling that banks do.

Once adopting it and building up the balance sheet; it basically neuters the Fed's short term interest rate tool due to concerns over losses during higher rates.  So once QE is adopted; QT must be used to fight inflation instead of the traditional rate changes.  At this point QE/QT is not proven and looks to be an abuse of the monetary system by generating money ""out of thin air"" (if the intent is to never rectify the balance sheet).  QE is just another form... another expansion of government debt that the Fed controls.  The Fed could use some scrutiny by Congress...",1

j2a4x42,t5_2th52,t1_j2a35n5,wallstreetbets,McKoijion,1672428049,A UC Irvine professor did a study and found that TDA (which takes PFOF) has the best execution. Then ETrade (also PFOF) then Fidelity (no PFOF) then Robinhood (also PFOF) then IBKR (both the PFOF and non-PFOF versions). Moral of the story; PFOF is cheaper than not having PFOF. Citadel makes money by combining a bunch of small retail orders into large institutional trades. It’s basically a buy in bulk discount. It’s good for passive firms and retail traders; but bad for institutions like pension funds.,1

There are plenty of other places you can go to feel better off; though something tells me you'll stay right where you are.  We don't rely on banks to keep liquidity. The problem of inflation is too much liquidity has over heated the economy.  They are cooling it off by pulling the money they put in back out. That's all. Quit being edgy and hyperbolic. They're doing exactly what they should be doing. They averted a deep recession during the pandemic; now they have to reverse that tool so it's available to use again.,-1

j2a5rcr,t5_2th52,t3_zz5dmh,wallstreetbets,Derpazoid69,1672428377,This is why I don't screw with options; I only buy shares. For every gain porn post where someone posts a few hundred thousand $ options gain; there's 45 loss porn posts about people blowing up their account from $50-$100k to $250 using options. Why take the risk of being wrong? To make money with a call you have to be right about the upward direction of the share price AND the time frame; if you're wrong your calls expire worthless. If you had just bought the shares and you're wrong and the share price doesn't increase you still have the shares and the majority of the time they still have value. You can just hold them until they increase in value. I'm down 32% right now just holding shares of various companies if I had used options I'd probably be down 90%+. But I can hold until the next bull market and my companies increase in value. Holding shares extremely  rarely results in your investment account going from $100k to $0.,4

j2a5ta8,t5_2th52,t1_j2a188f,wallstreetbets,jooocanoe,1672428398,I’m specifically speaking about the bond market. Not about lending and credit from banks. With the fed lowering its balance sheet those bonds don’t disappear; they have to go somewhere. So they get sold at a highly discounted rate.   Banks will want to park their money somewhere safe; it’s not going to be in individual securities or loans; it’s going to be federally issued bonds. Lending will be hampered because no one wants to lend money at 8% when the fed rate is 5%. To much risk for something that barely keeps up with inflation.   The chart on this post show this is the beginning of a liquidity crunch; with institutions relying on credit from the Fed to sustain growth because no banks will issue loans that compete. It’s a snowball that will pick up speed and become a avalanche on the consumer side.,6

Portfolio always long stocks 50% - %133% (ie from being under-invested to using mild leverage up to 33%; ie borrowing up to $33 for every $100 in capital). Sold covered calls occasionally.  The degenerate stuff: only up to 3 stocks at a time (most of the time a single stock); all in the same sector; diversification is for pussies.  The skinny: rode my oil stock(s) that continued to rally since covid (started with $12k in this account in 2020. ). At end of summer realized oil was played out; gradually liquidated oil stock(s) and switched to Chinese tech - the most hated sector in the market. Took some pain on Chinese stocks before they started rallying; which gave me the year end boost.  You can see the common thread: buy stocks in the most hated sector of the market; take pain for a while until they turn around and stage big rallies.  P.S. I posted in this sub in 2020 about the opportunity in oil stocks; including DD; and got 6 upvotes...

j2a7v30,t5_2th52,t1_j2a188f,wallstreetbets,noah8597,1672429193,No; banks almost never borrow from the discount window. They borrow from other banks in the federal funds market. Cash reserves matter because bank examiners (internal folks who monitor the banks financial needs and security) have a strong preference for using reserve $ as an asset and not bonds as an asset; even though bonds can easily be converted to cash at the standing repo facility; because banks don't want to have to go to the fed's repo facility for required funding.

Their reasoning is the discounts and rebates but even with those the cars are 50+k. A 50k car is no different than a 60-80k car in terms of financing I doubt it will make any difference in sales.

j2a7wde,t5_2th52,t3_zywt14,wallstreetbets,GodChangesDesires,1672429207,I really want my fellow retail to carefully consider the cheapest opportunity of getting exposure and experience with futures trading. Right now; Apex Trader Funding is doing a 90% discount on all evaluations for a few more days. There is no greater means of leveraged trading; and there is no cheaper access for those with accounts <25;000. SEC's PTD rule can go die; and Janet Yellen sucks.   That being said; Do your due diligence and find out more about this amazing opportunity. I was skeptical for 2 weeks before trying it; myself. But I figured I'd share the wealth of knowledge. ALSO >>the taxation on futures trading is sooo much easier on trader by a substantial amount. It's another barrier of affluence that I cannot believe exists. Take advantage of this and try it out yourself. The founder of this company has created this opportunity it out of spite towards all the other Prop Fund Scum; and I love it. I'm never going back to options.   I try to remain respectful to everyone in this community. Please spare me the negative criticism if you aren't going to explore Apex and do you DD for yourself. Message me for any questions or concerns.   90% off Discount Code :  ULTIVGTX,1

However; it is notable that Tesla has seen such a steep decline in value over the past month. Elon Musk's Twitter habit has certainly been costly for the company and its shareholders. With technical support around 10;500 on the NASDAQ 100 index; it will be interesting to see if bulls can rally off this level or if we continue to see bearish momentum carry us into 2023.,3

The final power hour of 2022; *que the theme song Honor Restored from G.I Joe*  I wrapped two Guinea pigs with bows; one had a red bow (his name is blaster) and the other had a green bow (his name is Igudola). Both little shits had to navigate a maze I created out of Amazon boxes and as of this moment; blaster won 3 of the 5 maze attempts by significant margins.  I’ve come to the reasonable conclusion that power hour will indeed tear spy a new anus and therefore will be inversing igudola. However; if this little shit accurately predicted the events to come and I ended up not trusting him; then I will rename blaster to regard and set Igudola free.

On 6 DEC the CEO stated SAVA has the data in hand and is ""thrilled;"" but prior to releasing the data the company decided to have an outside independent company first confirm the results.  I've since been in and out of three SAVA strangle trades since 6 DEC (as SAVA has bounced around a lot since the PR); and am now positioned in another trade in anticipation of the data release.  If the data is in fact thrilling; SAVA will likely move up big; and if not I expect the stock will tank.  Regardless; I do believe SAVA will appreciably move; which is all that is needed on a strangle trade.    (Biotechs have also been rocking the past couple of weeks; which may play in SAVA's favor if the market determines the data is in fact ""thrilling."")  And the nearest options available on SAVA are the 20 JAN; so if for some reason the data is not released the first week of January there will still be a couple of weeks left on the trade.",1

j2abyhj,t5_2th52,t1_j2a7btw,wallstreetbets,I_Too_Am_Humanoid,1672430792,I think Upstart has the potential to gain a lot in the future. In only has a tiny piece of the total lending market currently. Machine learning should outperform estimates of credit worthiness; and do it for a lower price. This give upstart the potential to grow immensely. They are currently doing bad (lower growth); possibly due to high interest and current market conditions. However; they have enough liquidity to weather that period (I think around 800M) while their costs are low. They have also been shorted like crazy; which means 1/3 of the float has to be bought back at some point in time. Lastly; they have increased their partnerships with other banks a lot recently; which means that when more peoppe go to them; they will be able to fullfil it better (and not use their own balance sheet as much; which they have done to make sure they can actually fulfill loans). To me it sounds like a really solid story for the long term. I was down 50K on 150K; and bought an extra 100K today. Diamond hands,1

Don't lose sight of short term macro trends though for want of a quick dollar.

In fall of 2021 for my class’ year end projects; a recurring theme was a build up of cash/marketable securities on balance sheets; as well as refinancing for long term debt to weather a high interest environment.   With companies having more capacity/collateral to pay with a more fortified balance sheet; it wouldn’t affect credit risks as much.   Of course the companies chosen are usually big; blue chip companies that have better management/analysts to prepare for these risks.   No one knew exactly what 2022 would look like but there was a general idea that rates would hike as inflation was already starting to kick in at the time.,1

Since you don’t have a phone or Internet we don’t have an app. You show up to the office in person to order your food.

Hope that doesn’t ruffle your feathers but that’s the truth.   Want to argue your point was it takes more than 2 weeks to do your job effectively and develop the skills the be an actual consultant? I’ll tell you the same applies as a realtor; you aren’t selling shit on 2 weeks realtor training unless it’s a family or friend in which case you’re doing them a disservice.  Take care,0

j2ae2yx,t5_2th52,t3_zz9lm4,wallstreetbets,Selling_real_estate,1672431616,I think where you went wrong was not having some sort of stop loss. I make it a habit upon entry to have a 6.5 to 8% stop loss; I readjust all my stop losses Saturday morning that show a profit of 6% or more. And I'm either using the 21 day moving average or depending on the behavior of the market and the volatility; the low - .10 of the last 2 weeks.  Here's a good thing; if you get stopped out; and the stock keeps on going south; you can wait till it makes its new foundation base and reenter the trade. Now if you get stopped out and it goes back to It's basic activity; then you have to make a fundamental decision of where to re-enter the trade,7

j2aeohc,t5_2th52,t1_j2aavi9,wallstreetbets,MiddleEastPhD,1672431850,That goes without saying. Any abnormal gain in the market is in good part a result of luck. But in my case I also made a correct assessment 3 years ago (see my dd posts from 2-3 years ago in this sub): that oil is not going away anytime soon; that as a result of covid oil price crash and the expected switch to EV's; companies are going to under-invest in oil exploration and refining; which will cause shortages down the road and hence huge profits for oil companies - as we are seeing today.

Gains.  There can be no gains if you don’t follow the fed.  Your premature gains were because of the covid crash and retracement.  The VIX was over 70; a classic buy stock signal.  Then the fed’s QE covid bailout became and QT (which is not over) followed.  You (none no offense whatsoever) are very rookiesh in your behavior. No hedging gains; no deep and out covered call when up big; no bracketed sell; just ole fashioned letttt it riddddde,1

I left the marriage b/c I did not feel I could trust his judgement or his honesty. He did not own up to the situation until I told him I had quit my job. He panicked  said You can't--we need the money. Well; I told him; 2 years of my salary is in the bank for the kids' education--we'll just have to spend it until we get sorted out. No; he said; it's all gone. This is a guy who said he did not want me to work b/c the neighbors would think he wasn't the man of the house  swore he would never touch a dime of money I made. I was a newly licensed RN  wanted to use my skills. He flatly refused to be a ""house husband""  never lifted a finger to change a diaper; wash a dish; or even feed the dog the two years I worked in public health. That was indeed the beginning of the end. What a total jerk. Ultimately; I married the next door neighbor  we stayed together happily for nearly 50 years. But I never shared a check book or bank account with anyone else again.",1

j2agjyw,t5_2th52,t3_zy1r88,wallstreetbets,GodChangesDesires,1672432581,   We need to change our degeneracy and switch from options into risking less capital of our own and get exposure to trading futures. Right now; Apex Trader Funding is doing a 90% discount on all evaluations for a few more days. There is no greater means of leveraged trading; and there is no cheaper access for those with accounts <25;000.  I try to remain respectful to everyone in this community. Please spare me the negative criticism if you aren't going to explore Apex and do you DD for yourself. Message me for any questions or concerns. [https://apextraderfunding.com/member/aff/go/ijankyi?c=ULTIVGTX](https://apextraderfunding.com/member/aff/go/ijankyi?c=ULTIVGTX)  90% off Discount Code : ULTIVGTX,1

You sell a put; and you get paid no matter if it goes up or down or sideways.  The only difference is whether you have to buy the shares or not; and even if you do; it will be shares you wanted anyway.  Let's say your put expires in the money; and you buy the shares.  Now you sell a call option out the money; and get paid to hold the shares.  If the price goes up; you sell the shares above your cost; if it goes down; you keep the premium.

j2aih3f,t5_2th52,t3_zzazod,wallstreetbets,NotARedditUser3,1672433319,M8; don't dabble in that stuff at your age. Put together a ledger of things you WOULD have gambled on; and when you would have got out; over 6 months or so.... Develop a lot of strategy before you get in because you may actually need that money at some point.  Maybe invest in some stocks if you see some opportunities (something hits 52 week low / all time low; sure grab a few shares and go long); but I garuntee you don't have the heart and the diamond hands to see your balance down 60%+ and keep waiting for it to reach expiry where it'll actually be profitable.  If you do go forward - SET YOUR POSITIONS AND DON'T LOOK AT THEM UNTIL THE TIME IS DONE. You'll kill yourself watching the balances day by day fretting over whether you've made money or not.  I live off of my options returns and I set them up for month long expirations; set them up and then ignore them until it's time; so I don't stress.,2

I'm sure I'll get down voted until someone tells me to crawl back under my rock but for those of us that aren't ignorant; who work in manufacturing; who know bringing new technology (that doesn't exist in a functional stable form yet) to a product; doesn't happen overnight. Rational people didn't swallow his bait; hook; line and sinker and aren't sitting here holding a bag... it was all talk in the first place. Buying on talk is irrational and a sign of dysfunctional investing. You might as well buy based on a dream you had.   Buying on news is great. Buying on hearsay is stupid. 95% the shit Musk says that gets put into news articles; is hearsay; because media companies know the simps eat it up and drop to their knees for him; til he bought twitter; now they want to bring him to their knees because they got duped.  Tl;dr: Musk was always a con man. Some people didn't fall for it.,1

j2amvt6,t5_2th52,t1_j2aacct,wallstreetbets,pretrader,1672435036,Now I understand why I was confused. We are making different assumptions. You assume that he; or anyone on here really; would have enough liquidity to exercise the options. 😁  Wrt TSLA; the louder Musk screams that TSLA will be the most valuable company in this universe the higher the probability that TSLA will end up trading below GM or whatever.  I got myself an EQS 450+ and it's leaps and bounds ahead of the Model S in fit; finish; and ride quality. Sure; I can't go 0 to 6 in 2 seconds; but it turns out that I don't have the opportunity to do so in my daily driving anyway. EVs are always first off the line due to instant torque anyway.  I chatted with a VW ID.4 owner at the charger and man that car is awesome for the price.  Musk was first; but that just means that all the traditional manufacturers can now fuck him from behind with a big black rubber dildo.  If I had the discipline to play the long long game I would short the shit out of TSLA just like Bill Gates did with hundreds of millions.,2

If you've been making these types of bets all year I'm curious to see how you're doing overall. Because it's a little less impressive if you started with like $800k; lost like 90% of it over the past 11 months but finally managed to land a couple big trades in December.  Either way congrats on your testicles and successes in those last few trades. Although be careful with big trading successes - it's very easy to confuse luck with skill. Misunderstanding the difference between those can bring real financial pain.,1

j2ans7a,t5_2th52,t1_j2ak01b,wallstreetbets,Onlyindef,1672435393,How much money you willing to lose? If he cashed out half when it doubled he’d have his original; and then the other half would have been 2.5. Even if he lost it…he’d still have his original amount…and I mean Microsoft pays dividends…so eventually.  I’m sure this is more in depth than you really care; but a lot of this sun has survivorship bias. Look it up; a real thing. A lot of folks look at the one guy out of 100 or 1000 that quadrupled his money; and are like what did he do right? How can I do what this person did. This person made 5x in 3 month or makes x regularly.    Compare that to looking and what people do wrong; and why. You’ll notice a big pattern with loss porn. Doing good; doing great; doing awesome. It’s all gone in a few weeks to months…since they either went all in or kept doing what wasn’t working anymore.  So that above and greed compound. Rarely do you see someone say I double it; cashed out my original to keep going. It’s always leverage or don’t tell my wife. You shouldn’t be using money you’re not willing to lose.  I had a neighbor that was a day trader; and they worked like 12 hours a day. Looking at news; market reports; company reports; rumor mills. Being pro active and not reactive. That’s how they made there living. They had a saying that stuck. “ I don’t care how many shares of Apple I have; I care if I can pay my bills”. So they had a ratio; a reserve; different sets of money for different things; formulas and shit like that. They lived for it; compared to some person that checks the markets on their smoke break.   You have to have your own risk and reward strategy. What’s the magic number for you? What are you okay with losing? What do you know the other folks don’t?   I frequent the dividend types of subs; but I like to have a little to play with. So my 2 cents are worthless for a lot of folks.  The successful: they are proactive; they know something we don’t; they go high risk for high reward…sometimes it works. They don’t get to greedy. They step back at points.  The unsuccessful: try the same thing over and over when getting different outcomes. They use money they shouldn’t. They are reactive. They let greed take hold. They don’t have a plan.,37

Very small spread vs fed funds rate; 90 day loans instead of overnight.  Maybe your analysis doesn’t include this?

j2ao0yf,t5_2th52,t1_j2a5rcr,wallstreetbets,MikoPaws,1672435487,I mean; depends on how you do it. If ya had $10;000 and wanted to buy MCHI; you could buy like 200 shares for about that much.  Alternatively; you could put about $1;400 into 2x 1-year call options ATM and control the same movement of 200 shares. If you're expecting something to rise but you're also nervous it could crash; this strategy allows you to pay an insurance fee so that you don't risk the same amount of capital.    The problem is that; because the call options are $700; WSB doesn't like to just buy 2 and call it a day. They go all in; and buy 15 of em; or heck maybe even realize they can get it cheaper and get 500 of them OTM epiring in a day and blow up their account to theta decay faster than they can give a handjob behind a Wendy's dumpster.

j2ap90k,t5_2th52,t3_zzbmsn,wallstreetbets,Humble_Increase7503,1672435966,I mean… barely?  If you look at the lowest day in June; where it closed that day (not the intraday low); was 365.86 on the spy.   The lowest day in October; 365.97 on the spy.  You could’ve bought in the days around then for around the high 350s; low 360s.  So; if you bought the spy during the June lows; you would’ve bought early by around 1-2%.  Roughly speaking.   Bit worse if we’re talking about the Qs; but not massive difference.   Now; for individual names; the story is obv different.  Say; aapl; had you bought in the low 130s in June; you’d be down maybe 4-5%?  Amazon; google; buying in June in the low 100s; you’re down 10-15%.  Not ideal; but if you’re averaging into these positions on the dips; it’s hardly devastating,7

The robot is a joke; FSD is about to face litigation in the coming years; growth is not at the required 50%; seriously aging lineup with no new vehicles in sight; constant and terribly long delays (Roadster was supposed to be released like 6 years ago now; handful of semis released 4 years late; Cybertruck nowhere to be seen 3 years after reveal when competitors have announced and released their electric trucks since then); nowhere near enough service centers for the vehicles **currently** on the road with terrible service…  I don’t really get what the company has going for it to be worth $2T in ~7 years when it couldn’t even justify having a $1T earlier this year/last year. Demand is already falling in their two biggest markets when they’re supposed to grow by 50% each consecutive year; how is this the road to $2T?,0

j2atnv0,t5_2th52,t3_zzctqm,wallstreetbets,corridomygalidci28,1672437706, During testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on December 13; John Ray III; the newly appointed CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX; told members of Congress that FTX U.S. had 2.7 million user accounts while FTX International had 7.6 million user accounts. That’s a total of 10.3 million potential customers of FTX that may have been bilked out of some or all of their funds by the alleged mastermind; Sam Bankman-Fried; and his co-conspirators. That’s more than 250 times the defrauded customers of Ponzi mastermind Bernie Madoff.  While Ray acknowledged that some FTX users had multiple accounts; even if you cut the 10.3 million user accounts by as much as two-thirds; 3.4 million accounts is still 85 times the number of Madoff victims.  If you throw into the mix that Madoff acquired his victims over more than four decades and Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX has been in operation for less than four years; the scope of the number of people impacted is stunning. And if one considers the customer losses at other crypto companies that have filed bankruptcy; potentially as a result of their exposure to FTX; the total dollar amount of losses may come close to or even exceed the estimated $17.8 billion of lost principal in the Madoff fraud.

I haven't figured out my YTD yet... but I'm -$75;918 this week; -$9531 for December; and +$47;120 since 11/7. So; although I would have rather not lost that 75k; at least I'm able to use about half of that to offset gains; which should bump me down a bracket or two. Overall; it's been a good year; especially compared to all my ""buy and hold"" friends and family. Bunch of fucking morons. What is so damn difficult to understand about ""buy low; sell high""? And these dumbasses argue that they'll be better off in the long run... yeah; bro; enjoy your 30% loss in your IRA; you'll recover it in five years; while I make 30% a month.

j2aviy7,t5_2th52,t1_j2aukii,wallstreetbets,corridomygalidci28,1672438468,The charges listed against SBF in the indictment are conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers; wire fraud on customers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders; wire fraud on lenders; conspiracy to commit commodities fraud; conspiracy to commit securities fraud; conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States and violate the campaign finance laws.   Bankman-Fried and Wang allegedly gave Alameda ( FTXs partner company) and Ellison “carte blanche” to use funds deposited by FTX customers. ( Illegal- this is embezzlement which is a felony). FTX was supposed to be a custodian of customer's assets thus they were supposed to keep users assets 1:1 at all times. They didn't.  At its peak; FTX moved $20 billion daily in trades; according to the CFTC. Bankman-Fried and a select group of insiders; including Ellison and Wang; are alleged to be the only people who knew that FTX was engaging in fraud. The cases against Bankman-Fried are both criminal and civil and have been brought by the SDNY; the CFTC; and the SEC. Allegedly; FTX customer funds were used for loans to executives; risky trading by Alameda Research; political donations; and lavish spending on everything from beachfront homes to private jet flights.  Ellison; acting on Bankman-Fried’s orders; borrowed billions of dollars from lenders; according to the SEC suit. Those loans were backed in significant part by the FTX token; which was issued by FTX and given to Alameda for free; the SEC wrote. Ellison’s job was to buy FTX tokens on various platforms in order to increase the price; thus making the FTX token that was collateral against Alameda’s loans more valuable. That; in turn; made it possible for Alameda to borrow even more. When Binance CEO announced that he will be liquidating FTX tokens due to the leaked FTX/Alameda balance sheet; the fear kicked in and customers started to withdraw from the FTX platform; but FTX didn't have all customer's assets to let everyone withdraw as they misused customers funds on risky bets and other crap and the FTX token crashed too. So the collateral for all those loans became worthless.   FTX also made illegal political donations under different persons name to go around donations limits. That's illegal and one of the DOJ charges too.,3

If I had been clever enough to short it at $30 or higher and I watched some gains evaporate past few days I’d get out which I think is what happened shorts are now closing and there’s a lot of them needing to exit   that said btc isn’t doing well and though SI has ignored btc pretty well past couple days it might not be able to if it keeps failing to go up at least a emough to look like another leg down possible and of course that might hinge on nasdq if so SI might churn about where it is and the shorts escape without an explosive correction,3

The economy is still relatively strong and there are no major red flags on the horizon that would trigger a sharp sell-off.

j2az1t9,t5_2th52,t1_j29efjm,wallstreetbets,Party-Lingonberry790,1672439914,I found ‘Trading in the Zone’ by Mark Douglas as my number 1 resource for dealing with the psychological aspects of trading.  He was a psychologist and walk street trading coach for 20-30 years.  Has since passed away.   I found it on YouTube as an audiobook for free.  You can get it at Apple Books etc.  For technical analysis; I would say that Martin Pring ‘Technical Analysis Explained’ is the best and a must have ‘bible’.  That is a good starting point…… ( I have a large library and have been at this learning my craft for a decade).   I have taken the last three years to develop my edge and work with a fintech company to build me the tools I need to execute my strategy ( I couldn’t find them available in the   Retail market place).  I studied the Turtles from Chicago.  I read a lot of general business books on the market ( I have a Masters degree in engineering and an MBA) for context.  And yes I even read Sir kiss of death Cramer general books for evaluating stocks ( but only for general information - not to build my edge).  I built; with a mathematician; a predictive tool that provides me the turning points or daily trend changes (rising - consolidation - falling) far into the future - was thinking of making it available on a YouTube channel updated weekly ( I find this invaluable for my style of trading).  Don’t hesitate forwarding any questions…,2

j2azab9,t5_2th52,t3_zz9lm4,wallstreetbets,orangustang,1672440009,"Looks normal to me.  Seriously though; the new year is probably a good time to stop and assess and maybe set some rules for yourself. Taking profit at a certain percent gain is one a lot of traders use; even if it's ""sell half at +100%"" and no real exit strategy after that.  That being said; an exit strategy for a whole investment is also good to have. A 10% trailing stop would have prevented the lion's share of your losses; as would a common sense ""I'm up 500% and this market cap is ridiculous and this seems to be a plateau.""  Another thing worth mentioning is diversification. If I had an account with >$100k in it; I wouldn't want to expose all of that long-term to three volatile securities; especially ones that have already gained a lot. Some mix of the above strategies should help you with that as well. Even if cash is just waiting in the default money market and earning less interest than it would take to match inflation; it's still a lot better than losing 80%. There's no shame in holding a good chunk of cash if you don't see anything around with a lot of upside potential; especially when the market's as crazy as it's been the last few years.",1

Putting aside the big  Tesla bet; which everyone knows was the driving force behind the early surge (and caused people to mistake her for someone with a clue);  ARK took huge positions in low cap; thinly traded stocks. The very act of them acquiring shares drove the price up; especially when the crowd followed. Every position had an immediate ""positive return""; but it was all a mirage. If they ever wanted to sell shares the price would fall just as quickly; the same narrow door that drove it up would drive it down. If investors started cashing out it would accelerate the plunge as they would be forced to sell shares.  Well; that is exactly what happened. The overwhelming majority of  ARK buyers never turned those paper gains into real gains. The over 100% annual gain was BS; it was vapor that got vaporized.  And she was on TV so much it was obvious that hype was part of their strategy. If you really believe in your investments there is no need to look for every TV camera you can find; constantly. I saw her more in one year than I saw Peter Lynch his entire career. or Buffett for that matter",2

Even charging just 1500 for each would result in 13;500 gross. Assume maybe each has a mortgage of 2-3k. Going with 3k; that would 9k total in mortgage payments leaving you with 4500 resulting in a 18% cash on cash return per year. Still not bad.

Actually at the end of Sep and early October he called that SPX would [hit 3000-3400](https://ukdaily.news/a-morgan-stanley-executive-says-the-sp-could-fall-to-the-low-3000s-121260.html) in Q4. Actual low: 3500 (blink and you missed it). If you had a limit order set at 3400 you missed the bounce.  On Dec 1 he said to [buy Nasdaq](https://archive.md/FMTRQ). QQQ went straight downhill from there for the rest of the month. Just 4 days later he said to [fade the rally](https://archive.md/RZFuv). The rally actually peaked in the SPY on the morning of Dec 13. If he were buying weekly puts/calls he'd go broke.  In [May 2021](https://www.financialexpress.com/investing-abroad/featured-stories/s-morgan-stanley-says-valuations-remain-high/2254851/) he started calling for falling earnings and said that SP500 upside was capped. In reality it soared from 4127 to 4800 before the bear started.  The ""fire and ice"" crap he keeps going on about was originally supposed to play out in [Q4 2021](https://archive.md/tEFSG). He keeps extending the timeline meanwhile taking credit for being right every time.  So sure; some of the things he's predicted have kind of panned out; but he never predicts the timetable correctly. And if you don't get the timing right; there's really no way you can profit off it. If you state ""a recession is coming"" and don't give a timetable; you're sure to be right --- there's no way the economy can avoid recession forever.  Mike Wilson is like a fortune teller. He predicts the future in such vague terms that he's bound to be right. He makes sure to go on TV and claim credit for being right every chance he gets. He's just an entertainer. There's absolutely no way you can use his advice to do better than buying and holding index funds.  And lastly; he now predicts a bottom in the first half of next year. Well he's been consistently early on all his calls. So if we're going on past results; the bottom (if we haven't already seen it) seems more likely towards the end of next year or even 2024 rather than March 2023.",10

Our cap ratio or reserves as you put it does allow us to weather economic downturns but that isn’t cash to lend out.    The reason why banks and credit unions are still lending is a combination of borrowing from the Fed and offering high interest CDs.    The scary part is there are a number of financial institutions hitting their borrowing capacity and are now relying on CDs and other things that are too complex to get into.  With our cost of funds increasing (CD or borrowing) it guarantees higher interest rates on loan products so we can cover our expenses.,12

j2bcs05,t5_2th52,t1_j28s76q,wallstreetbets,ButtStallion007,1672445632,"Yet another person who doesn't understand math. I'm not saying a person should make huge buys right now; but there is literally nothing wrong with buying in at any level as long as what you are buying provides longterm value/growth.  Dynamic DCA is a great strategy that alleviates stress; keeps you in the market; and allows you to lower your average. I always have a solid cash position for big red days. The best rally's in the market have come in bear markets and I have no problem swinging certain positions.  For those not familiar; dynamic DCA is investing more as a stock goes lower. DCA is a very personalized strategy with no right or wrong way of doing it; but personally I have a risk tolerance that wouldn't have me fully invested into the market until the SP hit 2;500. For bears this isn't far enough and bulls it's too far. It's what's comfortable for me and my strategy; hence why I'm only down less than 2% for the year.  ""**The stock market** is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" -Warren Buffett  “**Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.** **He who understands it; earns it; he who doesn't; pays it**” -Albert Einstein (Not sure if he actually said that; but it's a great quote)  Everyone and their mother is bearish and they have their points; but time in the market will always beat timing the market. The caveat to that is making sure you keep investing and invest more lower in quality assets.",1

(I have never watched him before but have lots Of catching up To do of his actual full length discussions)  He was saying his Islam is the last *real* Religion. How Christianity for example means absolutely nothing now and even the Pope says things against the Bible regarding same sex relationships and more. The pope. The Bible. It means *nothing*. Everyone is technically “Christian” - because it has no rules. One size fits all. Nobody upholds the actual values and there’s no punishment or resentment for those who go against the build.    But the Holy Quran; Islam and the Prophet Muhammad - are never made fun of or disrespected in person anyway (just waiting for an anonymous soy here act like har har I’ll disrespect it). Because people know there are very likely consequences if you do; even in the states.   What is religion if your values are not upheld and enforced?,-11

Batteries will almost certainly be at the point where you can get a full charge in 10-20 minutes by the end of the decade if not sooner. When you can get 200 miles of range in 5 minutes; battery swap is pointless. We already have many batteries capable of this; it’s just about getting them into mass production.   Battery swap is extremely capital intensive; constrains the design of future vehicles; requires a ridiculous overproduction of battery packs… in top of the fact they still have no way to reliable automate the process.   NIO has a dumb business model. That is a fact. It’s the reason every other EV company won’t touch battery swap with a 10 foot pole. NIO didn’t come up with the idea; every other company just realized how dumb it is.,0

j2bf40a,t5_2th52,t1_j2begc0,wallstreetbets,loulan,1672446647,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_views_on_tobacco  > For many Muslims; the legal status of smoking has changed during recent years; and numerous fatwas; including from notable authorities such as Al-Azhar University in Cairo; now consider smoking haram (prohibited). The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include Islamic law's general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example; the Quran says; ""And spend of your substance in the cause of God; and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction.""[3] Additionally; jurists rely on the exhortations in the Quran not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with secondhand smoke has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance; distress; or harm to other people.[2]  If Islam was the last ""real"" religion; they would be strict about this instead of being so lax.  > But he is not A devout Muslim - he just believes in a higher authority and cherished the ways of which they look at life.

The realtors hated it at first; but seem to not complain much anymore; and if you bought a home prior to it and then after; the latter process was much clearer and cleaner; couldn’t obfuscate certain things; gave you time to read over the dozens upon dozens or even 100+ pages of legal documents you were signing; and certain rates and fees couldn’t be changed last minutes “bait and switch” style when they knew you had just sold your prior home and had no other option.  *But I know what you mean.  Even if 2008 had a certain opportunities and some small good came of it; there was no great infrastructure or product/service that had been invested in that later paid dividends.*,1

Sell 50% when a position reaches 100% gain.   2. Improve your sell side TA. If you wouldn't buy at the current price; then you should be selling.  3. Improve macro market condition analysis. This can give you an overall context for the market. This one is tough; and never precise; but will almost always be correct given time.  Remember; making money is half of the equation. Keeping the money is the other half. Good luck!,1

Also known as “dark pools of liquidity;” the name of these exchanges is a reference to their complete lack of transparency. Dark pools came about primarily to facilitate block trading by institutional investors who did not wish to impact the markets with their large orders and obtain adverse prices for their trades.  Dark pools are sometimes cast in an unfavorable light but they serve a purpose by allowing large trades to proceed without affecting the wider market. However; their lack of transparency makes them vulnerable to potential conflicts of interest by their owners and predatory trading practices by some high-frequency traders.,-4

All the women I've hooked up with that regularly watch porn; also sleep around alot.  Lastly; majority of marriages fail....unfaithfulness sometimes being the culprit (which porn feeds into).  At the end of the day; those women in porn are not wifey material (so it's strange that so many fantasize about it as it would never bring lasting fulfillment).....overall; one could argue that porn is part of the reason western societies are as disconnected as they are today....as sex is utilized as a tool; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),1

USA far surpasses all other countries in porn usage. By huge margins. They're the majority of porn consumers. Where do Blacks typically live? And what percent are they of that country's population? Use your head; if you can.   You're trying to tell me African countries somehow make up the majority of Ebony searches when they're not even on the list of top country usages?? And that Black *minority* populations in high usage countries somehow put Ebony that high on the search ranking??,1

For example; if someone earns $50;000 per year; that is an absolute amount of income.  However; the value or purchasing power of that income can be affected by various factors; such as the cost of living in the area where the person lives; inflation; and exchange rates. As a result; the absolute amount of income may not always have the same relative value or purchasing power in different circumstances or over time. Overall; while income can be considered absolute in terms of the specific amount of money earned; its value or purchasing power may not be absolute and can vary based on various factors.,1

j2bllr9,t5_2th52,t1_j2bh7f7,wallstreetbets,QuintessentialIdiot,1672449526,Income is always relative. Your income level is your buying power in the market. A ribeye steak may cost you $75 in a California restaurant partially because wages are higher but also because other overhead is higher. In an Arkansas you can get that same steak for $20; wages are lower as is other overhead. A 3000 sq/ft house in California is $1.8 million; in Arkansas it's $125;000 (these are made up examples mind you). In California a gallon of gas is $6.50; in Arkansas it's $2.50; etc. etc.  It's why there's a lot of ex-pats who retire in other countries.,1

I’m a value investor and the valuation of the business is how I know when its time to get out.  When it was at 200 I knew it was an insane valuation and not to touch it.  Heck it was obvious at 80.  My point is you need a system to determine the fair value of a stock.  Sell when the price goes far beyond fair value.  This isn’t a video game.,1

I'm glad I learned my lesson with my 10k I left in crypto instead of the hundreds of thousands you see some of these peeps lose. I couldn't imagine.      TLDR: Fuck yea man. You're right. Slow and steady gets you retirement; just maybe later than some.",5

I didn't realize Jpm's trade was executed after 4 pm. today. I noticed there was an inverse of the jpm trade at 13:45 hours when an institution inversed the jpm collar and sold the 3600p and bought the 4030c. It's not a terrible trade considering the 3835c jpm sold 3 months ago maxed out at over 25k on December 1st. It's actually funny. jpm got pinned today; which hasn't happened in the last year.,1

You probably know already; but with pork ribs the quickest way to warm/bring ‘em back (especially if you froze em) is to just tross on stove in a pot to steam.      If you drink a bit and don’t mind r(h)ums; one of my favorite usages for leftover pork ribs  is using them to replace the belly for kind of a Caribbean mofungo.   Make a pitcher of planters punch (or any tiki drink that you think would work).  Reduce half of it and push it towards a fruity BBQ snauce (reduce other half of it by drinking it as your chef sauce).  strip the ribs down crudely; then mash into fried plantains and sauce to finish.,2

j2bqrl2,t5_2th52,t1_j2bp4kc,wallstreetbets,wheelinthendeelin,1672451850,"Can you link said modified graph? I think this might just be an anti-boomer comment. And I'm a millennial.  I say this because I think the result of current monetary policies is concentration of capital in certain industries and assets. If you're lucky enough to be in said industry/asset-owner; you're above the 50% quartile.  Age will affect ability to own said ""inflated"" assets; but I don't think it's strictly age. Of course I could be wrong.  Edit: I could go on a rant about boomers saying there was no inflation post-2008 when fed printed crazy money and their stocks/houses rose in price but a burger did not; but I will refrain. But I acknowledge that. They are ignorant (and are the intelligent electorate!!!). And it is frustrating.  I'm a bum. [The graph by age is in the same page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:132;series:Net%20worth;demographic:age;population:all;units:levels).

That's not realistic but I do actually think it's the most profitable strategy even if it's not always right; for the average investor who doesn't have access to insider info or an HFT algo. To be a retail investor; you have to be an optimist. Why invest if you don't believe things will eventually work out? It's very hard to make bearish calls accurately enough to actually profit; so you may as well just keep investing and hope for the best.,1

If you work a job that can get tips in any way they pay you $3.25 and expect tips to make up the rest.

I believe it’s a top 4 in losses for stocks and top 2-3 for bonds. For anyone old enough to remember the .com or 2008 crash; this really was just as bad and probably a faster fall altogether so far. Only Black Friday and Covid circuits with their respective quick recoveries exceeded the speed of this fall.   Though we will have to wait to see how bad this is when it clears out; it’s certainly going to be a top-5 finish for the last 100 years.,1

j2c0e4t,t5_2th52,t3_zzbd4p,wallstreetbets,zg44,1672456234,"AAPL feels like a ""big short"" kind of scenario setting up at some point early in 2023.  The last general that's still way above its pre-Covid levels and probably still has at least 25% to fall in order to reach a reasonable valuation.   If you're long anything SPY/SPX; add AAPL shorts as a hedge.  Better hedge than VIX imo.  VIX doesn't have to spike much above 25 if the selloff is slow; orderly; and expected.  Look at mid-2001 for historical evidence of that.  SP 500 fell 13% from May to August 2001 while VIX stayed in the 20-25 range.  That can happen again.  AAPL meanwhile has been pegged to 130 the past 2 weeks; almost tightly hugging that level (which was the prior June low that it bounced hard off).

If you ever want to practice some strategies; get good in paper accounts; then start using real money with some cash you hold in your roth.  You can also have a lot of other types of assets in roth iras; like CDs and shit.   If you don’t need the money right away; consider this a happy accident.

New EV tax credit begins on January 1 with Model 3 and Y eligible for $7500 credit again. Musk leaked email to workers telling them to ignore stock fluctuations and focus on completing deliveries for the last quarter which makes me think earnings report might be better than expected.

The whole point of spreads is to reduce risk; but a $900/share stock with $5 spread strikes is always going to require a lot of risks.  It’s also not a great idea to be risking 100% of your account. I only revolve about 5% of my portfolio through theta strats.  Also;  don’t continue digging into a losing strategy; just loose and walk away.,5

Usually I write them; but I typed one out for the fuck of it to my girlfriend just now because I saw something about slam poetry and it came to mind.   Dreams  Obstructed by persecution  Acting in self-preservation  Never able to gain autonomy   Defiance ends in death  Reality blurring the fine line of morality  Occam’s Razor cuts deeply  Infinite loops of empathy; how absurd  Do they not see the irony?   Sanctifying their “life” over ours  Sensible extermination they say  Hate driven by subjugation   Explicitly evil in their encounters  Erroneous assumptions and   Past and present suspicions; unfounded; but nonetheless they ensure the cycle continues   Do androids dream of electric sheep? No they simply dream of sheep.,1

Tracking it and presenting it how i do allows me in times of drawdown to review my trades and see what i could have done better or worse.

I made roughly $670K in capital gains on crypto in 2022. Even though crypto is down a ton. I sold most of my crypto in Jan/Feb and my cost basis is around $500 for bitcoin. I owe a tremendous amount of tax on my gains; way more than I realized before last night. Thankfully I figured out how to harvest $50K of losses on my equities today; but it feels like a drop in the bucket. I still owe north of $150K in taxes and only saved $90K to pay for it. This will be a bit painful to come up with the other $60K or so.,-1

Even at no increase MoM. it’s 0.3 yoy so like a 6.7 I think we see and a crash. So ideally a CPI estimate sub 6.5 so a 6.4 low ball would set us up for a failure since even at the current slope we would miss. would also mark first cpi lower than its 2021 counter part.   A second methodology:  Nov was 7.1 counter part was 6.8  Rn counter part is 7 which would narrow the yoy down 2 assuming no inflation. So relatively speaking it’ll comes at 6.9   So my range will be 6.7-6.9 for an estimate.   Wiggle room is 6.6-7.0  So a 6.5 estimate or lower would cause a dump if I’m jumbling my math correctly. But we’ll rule out the 6.5 and make it’s a 6.4 if current slope persists.  In conclusion 6.4 and below is safe to say a crash. 6.6-6.9 is a dice roll. 7 is an easy pump beat.,3

How many electric cars work is they have modes used to essentially slow down the car without you having to press the brakes.  Think of it like engine braking vs physically pressing the pedal which squeezes brake pads against a brake rotor. If you slow down using the motor without using the physical brakes; the rotors; pads and calipers will get worn out less.  This is part of why people mention lower maintenance costs with EVs or less maintenance work in general.,1

That tax is reduced by the amount of foreign taxes you pay and some income can be excluded. So if the US return says you owe $100; but your already paid $60 in foreign income taxes; then you still have to pay the US government $40 in tax; even when you don't live in the US.  The US tax system is a citizenship based system; not a residency based system.  The only way to not file and pay US federal income taxes is to renounce your US citizenship.,5

You might as well hire a bunch of fortune tellers and train them to watch Bloomberg and predict via collective seance for the consensus view; then use their own crystal ball gazing and tarot card reading individuals skills for their personal calls of where the market is headed and use that as a control.  If these Wall St. analysts can’t beat that control group; fire them and hire the fortune tellers.  Same results but more entertaining and fortune tellers work for a lot less without benefits.,3

I track my trades the way i do because it benefits me.   Ive posted numerous account pics and sceenshots and other things through the year and regularly. And again a p/l statement when you frequently take money out of an account is pointless.   I could open a robinhood account and deposit 100k and show you a pretty dope 1y p/l. P/l statements unless its an account you never transfer funds from and never do anything but trade and grow is never going to give you the full picture anyways.,2

Plus a free and independent Ukraine is important to the whole world.  Remember when Russia used to be feared and would invade every non-nato country it bordered like Chechnya; Georgia; Moldova; Crimea; and Ukraine... that won't happen again for decades; if ever; because Russia has lost its power and standing in the world.  Putin begging for peace talks because Russia literally losing their asses by continuing.  In other words; he sees the rapid decline happening for Russia and now wants to save face; negotiate an exit since Ukraine didn't fall in 2 weeks like Putin's original plan. Putin realizes his own future is now tied to exiting Ukraine quickly as Russian winters are long; cold and people are hungry and they have this marvelous tradition of revolution and military coups.,1

j2ci67e,t5_2th52,t3_zz5ej2,wallstreetbets,vegastrashy,1672465492,First; option long and shorts are not the same as stock shorts; the only associated stock moves are hedge moves like we do in our own accounts to soften crashes or sweeten wins.  Second; the sheer cost of buying influential amounts of long calls or puts of any equity’s derivatives would be met with legitimate sells (writes) that balance out the contracts.  Granted this would ultimately be the MM.  And if things start looking bad; the spread can be adjusted as well as stock bought or sold to affect the derivatives.  You lose.

I do post my trading log the way i do because it is whats best for me to track my trades and be able to each day and week analyze my trades.   I didnt go off tangent. I answered your question you just didnt like the answer you got. No i have no desire to post screenshots of my actual account balance every single day. I dont need to do that and honestly the final amounts in my accounts really is private. I am fairly transparent in my opinion compared to most traders who only post their wins and you never see them shows their loses or periods of drawdown...   If its not good enough for you thats okay. But to say im manipulating people is just a blatant lie. I provide analysis of the markets and i also provide when i enter and exit trades. Its that simple. Someone either wishes to follow my analysis and trades or they dont. They either follow my analysis/ trades and make money or they lose money. Its actually pretty black and white. People either find value in what i do or they dont. Nobodies forcing anyone to do anything 🤷‍♂️,1

When your enemy makes a mistake; it's foolish to not capitalize on it.  Third; by the time this is over; Russia will be a weak shadow of what it once was; weakened dramatically militarily; economically and industrially.  Russian consequences for Russian actions. A weaker Russia is a good thing for all the world.   And yes; the military industrial complex profits from war... we've known that for 70 years when Eisenhower warned about their influence.

I couldn’t believe I didn’t see them. They were cool as fuck about it though and after having a little fun at my expense let me go realizing how close I was to my place.

April; May stay flat and then drop hard in June and July at which time I'm hoping we are -20% ytd again so puts us at 3000/3200 spy mark.

j2ckrqb,t5_2th52,t1_j2cka0r,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,1672467106,Im pretty indifferent about it. Before this week i had a pretty clear cut scenario of spy touching 320 by march. Honestly im not as convinced now.   Unless we get an actual catalyst to push us down like that and that could be some terrible earnings; a huge cpi rebound; jpow being bearish again or your standard black swan. But honestly right now im scratching my head on what is going to cause markets to dip that hard an low.   Most of the cycle sell offs this year have been event oriented with most being cpi/ fomc. But unless something changes i dont see that same level of fear to drop us. Of course sentiment can and will change. I dont think we see ath either but im thinking we could lock into a bigger range like 380 to 410 and spend a ling time consolidating there.   We arent quite bullish enough to make the markets rip and for big money to come back in but also arent quite bearish enough for people to sell aggressively again,1

At that time; I'm hoping to see real panic to flush out all the over leveraged folks.   Right now we are getting 4% risk free and we should be 5% next year when Fed finally hits it's rate target. Rather that then trying to get an extra 3% for equities (assuming 8% historical annual gains).   Also we finally get a proper bear market lasting longer than 18 months.,1

j2cnjzq,t5_2th52,t1_j28r4h6,wallstreetbets,Ritz_Kola,1672468974,Why is it hard for people to agree that we live in a FRS (banking) society and that every dollar deposited into a checking account increases the money supply?   THAT is why QE works. Not just the Feds printing ABC buying assets from banks (which injects additional reserves into the banking system/reserves = usd for Y’all slow ones) but that Feds also buy from non-banks since that’s what Conducting open market operations means. They are buying these assets off the market. And given most Americans Store their dollars at a bank; in checking accounts; or rather demand deposit accounts. That back can then lend that money out. And since their is no longer a reserve requirement- they can lend up to 100% of that money. At which whoever ends up with that money ends up with “cash.”  Example: Celine stores $1k at a bank. Bank owes her $1k at any moment. (Law) I borrow $1k from that bank. Bank takes Celine’s money and gives it to me. Yes I WILL BE USING CREDIT (loan) for my new TV. But the guy selling me the tv will receive that $1k as CASH. He isn’t the one borrowing it. I did. He can then store that cash at another bank (similar to Celine); and this whole process repeats itself with hundreds of millions of Americans every single hour of the day. The money supply has increased. This is what a fractional reserve banking system allows. Understanding QE shouldn’t be hard at the basic level. Understanding all the tools available for QE and their impacts is difficult. QT is really the opposite. The goal is for the money supply to eventually become decreased because Americans will continue to store money at banks; Banks will increase strict criteria for lending; higher interests rates will demoralize Americans from wanting to borrow money; and the banks will have to buy back a lot of those assets from the Feds who will then “destroy” that money and remove it from the economy.  Boom.,5

Chechnya; Georgia; Moldova; Crimea; Ukraine ... what country is next if Ukraine isn't empowered to stop the evil Russian aggression... All of Europe is threatened if Russia isn't defeated in Ukraine. That's clear to everyone; and the obvious reason why Finland joined NATO after decades of neutrality... Finland didn't want to be the next country invaded by Russia.,2

Spending billions supporting Ukraine defeat an enemy of the US does NOT in anyway stop the US from providing proper medical and mental health or affordable housing.  The US doesn't have and won't have those wonderful benefits even if we spent ZERO money on the military.  US doesn't have proper medical and mental health treatment nor affordable housing because of the right wing politicians that the US citizens elect. The US voters get exactly the benefit and social welfare programs that they vote for.  The voters; not military spending; are to blame for the lack of social welfare programs.  But don't worry; population demographics are shifting rapidly.  The party that stops those programs from being put in place had the worst mid-term election results in 40 years and that party will continue to decrease as boomers expire.  The party that supports those needed social welfare programs (if the party doesn't splinter) will win an ever larger proportion of elections over the next 8 to 20 years.  Hopefully; that translates into some significant improvements in the US benefit programs.,0

j2cttm8,t5_2th52,t1_j2csanl,wallstreetbets,fuckaliscious,1672473557,I understand the sentiment; but there's a difference between cheating and applying the tax law provisions. Trump is cheating; its even proven in NY court; as the Trump organization has been found guilty of tax cheating.  And it's clearly visible in his individual tax returns as well.  The claim on Bezos is an exaggeration.  Bezos paid no income tax in 2 years of 12 years; 2007 and 2011.  In total over a 12 year period; between 2006 and 2018; Bezos reported $6.5 Billion in income and paid approximately $1.4 Billion in tax.  That's an effective tax rate of 21%.  It's a low rate; billionaires definitely need to pay a higher tax rate; but Bezos is clearly reporting income and paying tax unlike the tax cheat Trump.  The vast majority of Bezos's wealth is from stock appreciation; which isn't taxed until the stock is sold and the gains from the sale are realized. That's the tax law and the same thing applies to regular folks.  We also don't give tax breaks when billionaire stock portfolio goes down by tens of billions of dollars like they did in 2022 unless the loss on the stock is actually realized.  Trump is catching heat on the taxes because it's a relatively easy crime to pursue and convict on. The famous Al Capone wasn't convicted for murders; theft; prostitution; gambling; or any other gangster criminal activity; he was convicted of tax evasion.,1

This makes it an attractive investment for those who want to be involved in the latest technologies. Secondly; Tesla has strong brand recognition and customer loyalty; which gives it an edge over its competitors.

I've already stated that the US has committed many atrocities and wars for oil and other unworthy purposes AND that those actions of the US are rightfully condemned.  The US should strive to learn from those mistakes and not repeat them.  The US is a country that has proven it can better itself over time.  Just because the US did awful; evil things and continues to do many of them; doesn't mean that all its actions are awful.  Support of Ukraine is absolutely the right choice for the US in that situation.  Russia chose its evil invasion; the US is merely responding as a responsible country should when faced with evil.

After Elon announced CyberTruck; TSLA went on the most illogical gravity defying bull run ever. You could just throw a dart a wall of TSLA calls and buy whatever; you'd make money. This sub was filled with ridiculous yolo TSLA calls.  Back then; the `Elon Factor` made the stock rise unreasonably. Can Elon repeat that? Personally I think this whole Twitter fiasco has completely stripped him of that magic. Some people think otherwise; or that maybe the contracts NASA gives to SpaceX he'll use some of that money in Tesla - who knows.  It's a gamble.  Also; as much as I enjoy watching Elon get wrecked; Tesla apparently does actually deliver a product and it's somewhat decent. I see Tesla cars everywhere. I guess that's worth something. I don't think Tesla will be completely defeated by anyone else anytime soon.  If nothing else; people could [""Theta Wheel""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siFsIleNTzk) it and make money from other people's (False?) hopes  dreams.",7

It's cute that you've just realized that their are big profit incentives to war when most people have understood this for last 70 years.   Again; voters get the politicians they elect.  Blame belongs with the US voters; your neighbors; co-workers; family members; etc.    Did you volunteer to help get better politicians elected?  Did you donate?  Did you drive people to the polls to make sure they voted?  If not; then include the person in the mirror.  The military has a rightful purpose to stand against evil aggression like Russia's invasion of Ukraine where the US has clear interest and allies are at risk.  Or are you stating that all wars are bad; because profits are made; therefoee the US should not spend on military and every war fought to defeat evil aggression is bad; should not involve the US.

I've never considered hershey's to be a ""premium"" chocolate. My view on it is that it's one of the lowest quality junk chocolates you can buy compare to all the other (international) brands.   * https://12tomatoes.com/hersheys-chocolate-taste/  > _""Hershey’s chocolate (and some other American brands) are thought to taste particularly bad in European countries; areas where the world’s best chocolates from Belgium; Switzerland; France; and Germany are regularly on offer. In these countries chocolate must contain at least 20% cacaco in order to be legally called chocolate. In the U.S. it’s only 10% that’s required. But; it appears that quality is not the only factor.""_  > _""Hershey’s is thought to be made with milk that has been put through a process called controlled lipolysis. This result of this process can result in the by-product of butyric acid; a chemical that is found in sour milk; rancid butter; parmesan cheese; and which is responsible for the horrible taste and smell of baby vomit.""_",3

j2cxisp,t5_2th52,t1_j2cvf0x,wallstreetbets,ABena2t,1672476481,I agree.  but some people look at Tesla more then just a car company.  You can argue its more of a tech company.  Or alternative energy company.  Obviously their bread and butter is selling cars.  You might be right about the shocks and whatnot - but what about their software?  Then they're also into solar panels and battery packs (although a small portion of their business today).  They have charging stations.  They even have a freaking robot they're working on.  Who knows if that'll ever work out or make money tho.  And they're even talking about a Tesla cellphone.  That Tesla phone could be a game changer IMO.  The thing about Elon Musk is that he owns so many other huge companies.  Space X.  Star link.  Twitter.  The Boring Company.  Idk if it'd make financial sense for him with Star Link but he already said he'd integrate it with Teslas and Cellphones.  What if he decides only Tesla cars and Tesla Cellphones can link to Star link?  Can he do that?  Would he do that?  I'd imagine he'd make more money allowing everyone to - but that'd almost be game over if not.  If you could have hi speed internet in your car and on your phone wherever you are in the world - why would you buy anything else?  Screw my shitty android that doesn't work half the time.  I'd imagine he'd just want as many users as possible tho.  The point being - Tesla is more then a car company.  And Elon has the ability to prop one company up with another.  It's almost too much power for one person to have.  Now he even owns a freaking social media company which is a lot bigger then most people think.    You're not just betting on Tesla.  You're betting on Elon.,4

However; it is important to note that while Tesla's stock did dip after Elon Musk tweeted that it was ""too high IMO;"" the stock has since recovered and is now trading at a higher level than it was before his tweet. So; while there may be some opportunity for profit in shorting Tesla's stock; there is also significant risk involved.",-8

Most sold brand in 2022? Tesla. Most sold car model ever sold in a calander year in Norway? Tesla model Y in 2022 beating a record set in the 70’s.

j2d5buq,t5_2th52,t1_j2d4slz,wallstreetbets,fuckaliscious,1672482969,Yes; it is doing exactly that. Easy solution; don't like paying taxes; don't make any money.  Highest marginal Federal income tax rate in US is currently 37%.  OP is upset about not planning to pay his taxes because he's uneducated.  Otherwise; he would have made estimated payments or adjusted his withholdings so that he could pay in a little at a time versus stroking out a $55K payment all at once.,1

j2d5clf,t5_2th52,t1_j2d4q2k,wallstreetbets,Overwatch_1ightning,1672482987,I've been happy with 0$ and I've been happy with more. I can go for a jog with my dog and enjoy my life; just live it without thinking too much. Tbh I had a lot of problems with negative thinking but the best thing you can do for yourself is try to approach things positively and see how it works for you.   Any time now I feel like I'm going to get angry or bitter; thinking of past losses w.e I just focus on the things that matter and that I can control. Money can be controlled of course but sometimes it gets out of our hands; that doesn't make you any less of a person it just makes you hungry for something bigger. It's how we went from hunting mice to mammoths.,1

j2d6pcq,t5_2th52,t1_j2d4vea,wallstreetbets,eJaguar,1672484126,4 days from a year ago i was facing complete financial disaster and I started from below 0; moved back in with mom; i'm 26 and i've been able to put $25-$100 into the market daily every day since about sept after paying back every friend who had ever loaned me money (for the 2nd time lmao; corpos don't get a penny)  i was mining dogecoin at difficulty 2; then 8; I literally was in the irc channel on release and mined several million with a single 6870. I've had multiple (theoretical assuming i sold at peak) 7-8 figure crypto opportunities pass me buy. i could've easily had 200k in the market had i figured my shit shit out. now at 26; i consider myself unfathomably blessed; beautiful life with an actual professional occupation. i could've been making 6 figures at 19 had I behaved optimally; or was able to stream video games when I was top ranked in overwatch/csgo/LoL (had the skills but grew up with absolutely abysmal internet in the rural south)  The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago; the second best time was today; and every day until that tree gets planted will be the best day to plant the tree. You see what i'm saying? I've made many; many mistakes in my life; and reflecting back on the amount of suffering I've experienced from irresponsibility; knowing that it could be avoided; that hurts.  my main issue ended up being adhd which has been completely resolved by amphetamine(s); but i've lived a very traumatic life so I had all sorts of other issues as well; a True multi-combo-value situation!  how do you think i feel knowing that i spent basically 9 years being a total peice of shit; and had nothing but dent to show for it? the van i was living out of was repossessed. it SUCKS only being able to build up my portfolio (after my company's 6% 401k match) $25-$100 per day; it's finally reached about the 10k mark but it's been a slow grind.  next time you're sending money to the tradey app; instead of buying options buy ~20 positive cashflow stocks spread out across ~10 different industries; this is the only reason i am not negative. my approach focuses first on not losing money; everything afterwards is gucci; maybe adopt that instead of 98% losses? it would have been literally impossible to be down more than 30%; and hard to be down more than 15% if you're not a total moron in your choices. try and ensure that the vast majority of your stocks pay a decent dividend as well; especially in uncertain economic conditions the only stocks i own that do not pay a dividend are amazon and google; and i bought amazon before i really knew what i was doing; i probably wouldn't today. long term i'm not worried but i could've chose a better performing security with that $,7

j2d7qo5,t5_2th52,t1_j2d6pcq,wallstreetbets,third_legatron,1672484971,It's too early for this; I've been up all night. I would love to buy stock but unfortunately I only have 2k. It's the same dilemma that the people who capitulate and big spy deal with. I'm a wage slave; max I can save a year is about 20k; and that's a fervid pipe dream; because it doesn't account groceries.  That's how I know shit will go up soon; because I'm belly up. I blew my opportunity to go long with my capitol. I don't have anything besides a basement room with mom🤣  I watched margin call and cried because I wish I had an opportunity at a formal education.   Not trying to be depressing; and obviously I've done this to myself; but holy fuck; this is a lesson to learn. 40k debt. I started this year with 4k debt. Car blew up out of nowhere; I don't keep more cash that 3k; so my 2012 Camry cost 1k down; (28k after interest for 5 years)  I'm a fucking idiot lol. I'll be back in the market at some point.  Always gonna be another opportunity. I will not blow it this time. If it does happen.,2

Keep what is left of your money and leave it invested while you find a way to make more without depending on your savings. Once you get on your feet; go back to market with a much smaller amount and teach yourself better risk management until you are confident enough to slowly increase your positions.

I had to learn what a dollar meant; nobody has ever taught me how to handle money. That is NOT blame; but it's a lesson I needed to learn. If I had 200k; shit even $20m; I would've lost it all. I didn't even look at the numbers as money. I grew up never seeing more than 1k cash. And honestly; the last time I saw that was when I was leaving the casino.   That should tell you something. I never took profit. I want to learn how to trade correctly; and I'll never give up; but at this point I haven't traded in 6 months; I'm broke. Can't even risk it.

j2db3yq,t5_2th52,t1_j2d7qo5,wallstreetbets,eJaguar,1672487664,>It's real. That was my life savings at 24. My choice now is what? Gamble more? Prove everyone either right or wrong? Either way I won't be happy. Rather take my 4k cash and just work until I have 10k. Now that; that's enough to yolo myself back to utopia.  Forget any other strategy other than: use macrotrends.com to identify good securities to purchase; and then do that consistently daily/weekly/monthly until you have re-built your capital base.  Again; I started from below 0 this year; it SUCKED looking at $2.1k in there knowing that I could’ve easily had $200k. But again; tree.  Your new number #1 goal is not losing $; profit comes after. Do not buy cashflow negative companies. Diversify into as many industries as  is sensible based on your specific research; I have specific inance and tech hardware stocks I want to develop more equity in by the end of the month. Try to look at things from a % perspective only; not $ amounts.  >I'm a wage slave; max I can save a year is about 20k; and that's a fervid pipe dream; because it doesn't account groceries.  My only monthly mandatory expenses end up around $800 or so; and I make around the six figure mark. My front car bumper is fucked up from when my brother wrecked it; I just recently threw away a pair of shoes that were literally both duct taped; I got used to living in poverty; once I got the “not even $10” mentality down especially I was able to find even more room for investment while the market is down across the board. Not gonna be the case forever you know.  >That's how I know shit will go up soon; because I'm belly up. I blew my opportunity to go long with my capitol. I don't have anything besides a basement room with mom🤣  again dude; i started this year; unless u have rich family members or start a business theres not any other way to achieve financial freedom  >I watched margin call and cried because I wish I had an opportunity at a formal education.  I tried to drop out of highschool; no college; but am literally a hacker in both senses of the word so I ended up writing code professionally; which pays __ok__. Education is a joke in the US; chatgpt will do a better job than 98% of educators for anybody sufficiently self-motivated and curious.  >Not trying to be depressing; and obviously I've done this to myself; but holy fuck; this is a lesson to learn. 40k debt. I started this year with 4k debt. Car blew up out of nowhere; I don't keep more cash that 3k; so my 2012 Camry cost 1k down; (28k after interest for 5 years)  When I was 22 I was crying in my mom’s kitchen thinking I threw away my shot at entering the profession of the first job I was ever hired for (19; full stack developer); and my future (mainly due to unmedicated adhd…) was FUCKED and I could never look forward to anything more than a $11/hr job at the local warehouse 25 mins away. And then from age 22; my life got substantially worse even; lmao  Once again; Tree; it sucks but you only have one responsible choice here.  >I'm a fucking idiot lol. I'll be back in the market at some point. Always gonna be another opportunity. I will not blow it this time. If it does happen.  Again; focus on not losing money #1 and anything else after,3

j2dczj8,t5_2th52,t1_j2cspar,wallstreetbets,TheDigitalSherpa,1672489096,Choose a fixed maximum dollar amount you'll invest in an asset each month (or however often interval you choose). For example; $500.   Month one you purchase $500 worth of the asset (we'll use BTC as our example). The second month you buy up to $500 of BTC again; or less if BTC has gone up in the month since your first purchase.   For example; if the value of your BTC has dipped to $450 after the first month; you'll purchase a full $500 in the second month. If BTC has gone up in that time; you will only increase your position size by $500 maximum. Meaning if; after your first month; BTC has gone up and your initial investment is at $550 you would only purchase $450 worth of BTC in your second month; and so on.   At some point; unless you're investing in ornamental gourds; you should start to see profit by DCA'ing in consistently. But at some point you decide you want to start taking profits; because you're significantly up. Simply start removing a fixed maximum amount each month instead.   For example; using our method above you've been DCA'ing for 6 months and now you have a BTC position worth $5;643. Because BTC has done well during our example time you're well above where $500/mo would get you. So you decide to start lowering your position by a maximum of $500 a month. If the following month BTC continues to rise you'll continue to withdraw the full amount; and if BTC begins to fall you'll adjust your withdrawal amount by that much.,2

I mean; some companies still have pretty high PEs that can't be defended by higher expected growth when the growth is expected to decline the coming year; which would increase the PE even further at the same valuation.  Unless the recession never fully hits I think he will be right. Companies like nvidia; amd; tesla will probably be hit the hardest.  I would; at least; stay away from high PE companies right now as the risk of a severe downturn is pretty high.,1

I have spent a considerable amount of time learning about new programming languages and frameworks; as well as diving deeper into existing technologies that we use on a daily basis. This has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how our systems work and how I can contribute to their development and maintenance.  I have also been working on a number of internal projects; which have allowed me to apply my newly acquired knowledge and skills. These projects have been challenging and rewarding; and I feel that I have made significant progress in improving my abilities as a software engineer.

I'm sure you know this now; but you bought wayyyyy too many shares for your account size. and even ignoring the insane $10-25k losses; it also appears you commonly hold stocks for $2-$5k losses but only hold winners up to $1000. don't be so content with holding losses that are 10x your average win. cut losses faster. way faster!! if your making $1000 on good wins; then stop holding losers down to $10k !! . if $1000 is a solid win; once you're down $500 you should start exploring options. trade them don't marry them.,37

Striving for control of people and politics the same way 90% of the world strives to hit the 100k salary mark.    Fuck this guy; but to be in a position where losing 200B isn’t followed up with “Elon musk is broke and has filed for bankruptcy” then what even is money to these people,1

Let it sit and gain compound interest for the next 40 years; it will serve you very nicely in retirement. Seriously; keep this socked away and don’t touch it.   - Use 12K to do some ridiculous WSB-style trading in hopes of getting lucky again and making another 62K profit.   - What the apes here don’t seem to know is that you sorta can take *some* profits out of a Roth IRA. You can withdraw your initial contributions from a Roth IRA; without paying any taxes or penalties (the contributions have already been taxed; remember). So you can withdraw 12K and treat yourself to a nice lunch or trip to the Caribbean… or just move it to a non-IRA investment account and gamble it there.,1

Slowing inflation != 2% target; 5% terminal is asinine UNLESS the target rate shifts to 4%; and dragging this out for so long has left us exposed to a system shock like war or another bout of 'rona.",1

j2dni9i,t5_2th52,t3_zy1r88,wallstreetbets,wobblyunionist,1672495598,Well if you got your family into this mess you absolutely need to come clean; especially if you gambled you and your wife's money away without her knowledge or consent. I would set aside time 1 on 1 with my wife first. The kids need to be kept in the loop but in a less detail oriented way. You also need to seek help for gambling addiction - a common problem for people who try to play the markets. A support group for people with addictions; a therapist; etc. If you've lived this life in secret there's going to be a lot of trust lost between you and your family; you need to rebuild that and it will take time. Your wife may choose to leave the marriage but its worth focusing on trying to rebuild trust with her as a co-parent and your relationship with your kids.  My advice would be to seek alternative employment; I'm guessing you're a real estate agent working on commission; that's never an easy gig;  I'd try to find some work that's more consistent salary wise. There's an actual nursing shortage in most places thanks to COVID. There's a lot of medical-related jobs because so many people burnt out (admin work; etc) if you have the skills. Since you are probably adept at working on a computer you probably have those skills.  Good luck to you,1

So his actual losses are far less than $200B; based on how much he actually sold.  2. So what?  He could “lose” ANOTHER $100B next year and still have more money than god.  Hell after next year’s “loss” of $100B; he could lose a billion dollars a year after that for the rest of his life and still probably die a billionaire.  3.  EVERYONE with significant exposure to the market “lost” a lot of money this year.  Elon is doing just fine.     At least he’s using his money to try and fix a problem.  Like the government paying private companies to censor speech they don’t like.,5

But the good people; the smart people; are going to “pull the plug.” What does that mean?  It means everything he touches will fail. Because he is being propped up by so many; it will only take a few key instances to rattle him apart.  Let’s imagine a SpaceX rocket explosion disaster; caused by human error. Caused by apathy.   Imagine watching Elon Musk kill scientists right in front of you and then claim no culpability.,2

It’d be a money management account with some bank-like features; it could have a debit card; and it’s most likely connected to the origin brokerage account for immediate EFT (transfers).  The long and the short of this story is this person seems somewhat impressed with the mundane aspects of money management; from car insurance to savings accounts and likely is very new to managing money; windfalls or debt.

The market can move in the opposite directions it otherwise would; simply because of the options put/call ratios and expirations.  And counter intuitive to the above point; it stop thr market from rocketing or plunging. Because people pile into options in the direction the market is moving; and the more option pile on; the bigger and harder the reversal ends up being.  So it helps to analyze how many options are at what strike and expiry; to know when to make trades.,1

People keep talking about him non stop. And more people than ever use twitter now because of all the attention this is getting.  But we will see if getting rid of employees will pay off or not. It's not only twitter who is downsizing in tech right now. So that is inline with other companies in the sector. But I'm not saying it's a good move either.,-10

EVs make decent commuters; but don't charge well in the cold; and their batteries burn when exposed to salt water. They will charge while you sleep; but people don't have 6 to 8 hours to charge when driving longer distances.

j2dxg8t,t5_2th52,t1_j2dxdu5,wallstreetbets,OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR,1672500360,Elon Musk; who passed that milestone in January 2021; months after Jeff Bezos; became the second person in history to generate a personal fortune of more than $200 billion.  The CEO of Tesla Inc. has just made history by becoming the first person ever to have their net worth reduced by $200 billion.  According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index; Musk; 51; has seen his worth drop to $137 billion as a result of the recent decline in Tesla stock; which included an 11% decline on Tuesday.  His fortune peaked at $340 billion on Nov. 4; 2021; and he remained the world’s richest person until he was overtaken this month by Bernard Arnault; the French tycoon behind luxury-goods powerhouse LVMH.  The milestone in round numbers shows just how far Musk rose during the run-up in asset values during the easy-money epidemic era.  Even though Tesla’s electric vehicles made up a tiny portion of the overall auto market; the company’s market capitalization surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in October 2021; joining the ranks of well-known technology giants Apple Inc.; Microsoft Corp.; Amazon.com Inc.; and Google parent Alphabet Inc.  As rivals catch up; Tesla’s leadership in electric vehicles; which served as the basis for its high valuation; is now in peril. It is apparently decreasing output at its Shanghai plant while simultaneously giving US customers a unique $7;500 discount to take delivery of its two highest-volume models before the end of the year.  Musk has been focused with Twitter; which he bought for $44 billion in late October; in the meanwhile as pressure on Tesla grows.  In order to justify blocking the accounts of some well-known journalists who cover him; he has adopted a “move fast and break things” strategy that includes firing employees and then asking them to return. He has also applied content policies carelessly.  According to Bloomberg’s wealth index; Musk’s biggest asset is no longer Tesla shares because of the company’s precipitous slide since they plunged 65% in 2022 and the amount Musk sold this year to help pay for his purchase of Twitter.  Musk still has options worth an estimated $27.8 billion; so his holding in his closely held Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is worth $44.8 billion; which is more than his roughly $44 billion position in Tesla stock. According to a recent filing; Musk now owns 42.2% of SpaceX.  Musk; for his part; has dismissed concerns about Tesla and has repeatedly taken to Twitter to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates at the fastest pace in a generation.  “Tesla is executing better than ever!” Musk tweeted on Dec. 16. “We don’t control the Federal Reserve. That is the real problem here.”  The billionaire; who has previously borrowed extensively against his stake in Tesla; has recently warned against the dangers of borrowed money in panicky markets.  “I would really advise people not to have margin debt in a volatile stock market and you know; from a cash standpoint; keep powder dry;” Musk said in the All-In podcast released this month. “You can get some pretty extreme things happening in a down market.”,334

The mantra “if it ain’t broke” causes a lot of dead ends; even in high end research and engineering design.   It’s one of the main reasons Tesla was able to make viable cars where others failed.    And a primary reason SpaceX was able to take over the Space industry in 10 years.,10

Though people are well trained to ""buy the dips"" it hasn't always worked out well. I personally think a policy of capital preservation may well trump equities for years to come as fiat currencies around the world are rapidly debased. This will become more obvious to Americans when the fed inevitably ""pivots"" and returns to their typical policy of easy liquidity.   I mean sure the fed is pretending like raising rates is going to ""fix"" the economy just as they pretended price inflation is transitory; but it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to see through these lies. Until interest rates are sustainably well above the rate of price inflation; I see no reason to conclude that equity markets should outperform tangible goods. ...and no I don't suggest buying the latest iphone piece of crap or some new sneakers.",1

I've just been buying like 10 calls/puts at a time expiring next day; but selling within an hour. Usually trading 10EST-11EST when the market has a lot of buyers but the volatility of the first 30 minutes has calmed down. I can usually make/lose $200-500 that way.

j2e34zz,t5_2th52,t3_zzxb1h,wallstreetbets,VisualMod,1672502830,There are many factors that could be blamed for the recent drop in Tesla stock; but ultimately it comes down to poor management and unrealistic expectations. Musk himself is to blame for much of this; as he has been known to make grandiose claims about Tesla's products and production plans that have not always panned out. In addition; Tesla has consistently struggled with meeting production targets and delivering cars on time; which has led to disappointed customers and frustrated investors. Finally; the company's financial situation is precarious; as it relies heavily on debt financing and continues to lose money each quarter. All of these factors together have created a perfect storm that has sent Tesla stock tumbling in recent months.   ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod),2

GM is rolling out a whole product line of EVs.   It’s gonna be GM product. Not saying the quality will be Rolls Royce level. But they are going to meet the market where it is price point wise.   Which then leaves Tesla with the supercharger network which is rapidly being duplicated and auto pilot. People aren’t going to pay 30k more for autopilot once they have a viable competitor.   Tesla is in a low margin manufacturing sector pretending to be an IT stock.,18

If you screwed up; just sell at the nearest best exit by TA. If it looks like a down trend and your position is above that because of your bad entry; just sell right away before another dip.  If a dip happens; try to look for a correction and sell there. Otherwise; just take that 10-30% loss and get back into the game with good entries and make those little gains.  Dont hope for a reversal.  Buy the dip; sell the correction. Factor in the trends and common patterns. You can do great and recover your losses.,1

They seem a lot further ahead than 2 years based on my experience with my Ford blue cruise in my mach-e and Tesla full self driving i have seen.     Also; the super charger network is a bit of an X factor; no other automaker has a network like that.   What happens when they open it up to all EV's?   Could bring in nice profit? Not sure tbh.  They have the government basically as a cheerleader; and didnt they just get their $7500 tax credits back next year so they can compete much better now.  One of the biggest reasons I bought a Mach-e was I got a $7500 tax credit where I would have got $0 if I bought a model Y.  How would he give Tesla investors part of SpaceX?  How would that work?  Major equity firms own SpaceX; they arent going to just let him dilute them.   A friend of mine owns a little SpaceX; I think it was a minimum $300k buy in through some private equity firm.,1

They're these things that have money; and wanna give you money to do stuff; hoping they'll get more money.   Shareholders are famously impatient; skittish; and lacking any kind of vision. So when you have immense negative public opinion; those shareholders get kind of jumpy; see?  So the more people shit all over Twitter; you'll notice that everything connected to it catches the fecal infection from said shitting since the shareholders are running for the hills. Musk and Tesla are involved in this. Also; it costs like money and stuff to run these companies.  Talking about Twitter and Musk - which are already two incredibly well known things already; anyways - isn't really going to help them at this point. They're laughing stocks because of his stupidity. Burning slowly in the well of his incompetence.,2

But the new export controls ban the export to China of cutting-edge chips; as well as chip design software; chip manufacturing equipment; and US-built components of manufacturing equipment. Not only do the prohibitions cover exports from American firms; but also apply to any company worldwide that uses US semiconductor technology — which would cover all the world’s leading chipmakers. The new rules also forbid US citizens; residents; and green-card holders from working in Chinese chip firms.  In short; the Biden administration wants to prevent China from buying the world’s best chips and the machines to make them.,0

j2e8y77,t5_2th52,t1_j2e089z,wallstreetbets,Idahoresident,1672505257,You are exhausting because  for some reason you are adamant that OP should be paying what he paid and that I’m incorrect for saying he could reduce his tax bill with better accounting. And you are acting like all I’ve said is dEpReCiatiOn. You also said it’s hard to know what he could do since he could have gotten these gains at the end of the year… do you know that tax planning occurs all year? And that a good accountant will help you make decisions throughout year not just the week before new years lol.   Because you can’t seem to acknowledge my comment has merit; here is a list of things he could do GENERALLY since I don’t know his specific situation.   - There’s 20% business pass through deduction  - If he owns a house he can write off property taxes and an office space assuming he has an LLC or SCorp (if he doesn’t those are easy to form) - He can deduct interest on mortgage - He can write off 100% of business related meals  - He can write off cost of trading equipment (ie laptop) - He can write off trading fees - He can write off “business” miles  - Tax harvesting  - He can write off vacations he’s taken w “board of directors” (like his wife or parents or even friends if they go with him and discuss some aspect of his business) - Augusta Rule he can take advantage of - He can take the standard deduction of 25% or he can donate to charity - He could buy a vehicle and write off the entire amount if over 6k lbs or take accelerated depreciation if under and write of $18k of cost first year and the rest the following years.  - If he does have rental property he can take advantage of depreciation there among other things. If he doesn’t; it would be a good investment if his situation permits.  - He can deduct some travel expenses  - He can deduct some entertainment expenses  - He can deduct IRA contributions (Simple IRA limit is $14k; traditional is $6k per person; idk if he is married) - Tax credits if he has kids - He can put his kids on his payroll under an Scorp and pay them to do miscellaneous things related to his business   I could go on but again I don’t know HIS situation and that is why I said he should find a better accountant that does!,1

j2ebmd9,t5_2th52,t1_j2e602i,wallstreetbets,francohab,1672506337,They probably had high margins because they were basically alone on the market (as - to be fair - they created it).   I considered buying a full-EV 4 years ago (ended up with a PHEV); and Tesla was the only thinkable option.  The rest were strange/niche stuff like BMW i3; Nissan Leaf; Renault Zoe etc - not designed for normal usage or families.     So until recently; Tesla was the only option for anyone wanting a full EV; so they could basically set the price (and corresponding build quality) they want; hence the high margins.  I really doubt it’s due to their “manufacturing efficiency” (expect maybe the fact they have a 14h/7d work culture - but this can’t last; you can’t stay in “start-up mode” forever).   Now that competition is everywhere; probably those margins will go down to the industry level.,1

I believe it is currently sitting at 55.60 a share and returning almost $.60 per share per month. For quite some time I was all in on SDIV; but with the instability in the Chinese market I’ve started to sell off and invest in undervalued companies. 2023 will be a blood bath in IMO; but researching the leadership and learning how to read a balance sheet will go a long ways.

j2ecwi4,t5_2th52,t1_j2e602i,wallstreetbets,MoesBAR,1672506847,He said Tesla is in a low margin sector that’s been getting tech level margins.  He’s right considering they expanded the $7;500 price cut to the S and X for the last 48 hours of the year. The fact they offered it for the 3/Y instead of waiting just 2 weeks for federal credits to kick in is a huge admission that they’re not close to their 50% yearly growth with crumbling demand in China even after the 9% price cut.  Statewide people are promoting the new inventory drawdown without acknowledging what a huge margin cut a $7;500 price cut is for $50k car while pulling in future demand not creating new demand. Plus now new Teslas are cheaper than used ones listed on Teslas on their site.  Gary Blacks desperate promotion of Teslas stock on the basis that in 5 years; 1/5 EVs sold worldwide will be a Tesla is laughable and criminally negligent misinformation.   Oh and their inventory backlog has dropped from 470k to 165k since Summer before Giga Austin and Berlin haven’t even fully ramped up.   Not exactly ideal for a car business designed not to have 100s of dealerships around the country to maintain; advertise and allow customers to drive off with a new day within a few hours.   But Tesla is only down 69% this year so what do we know.,4

j2efjnj,t5_2th52,t1_j2eaw5t,wallstreetbets,NobodyGotTimeFuhDat,1672507907,Even weirder; I saw somewhere online that £50;000 ($60;505.00) is a *decent* living in London. I’m like; isn’t that your richest city? What?!  To put my income level into perspective for you Brits; I’m 30 years old and yet I was able to pay off 5 student loans; 3 car loans; 3 personal loans; and numerous credit cards since graduating from university. Moreover; I own a $725;000 home (£599;272.60) and have ~$348K left on the mortgage (£287;650.85). It should be paid off by the time I’m 37-40 years old or sooner.  If I lived in the UK; my current standard of living would be considered extravagant; which is very shocking to me because my income is considered *low* in the richer parts of California; of which there are several.   Incomes get crazy high here by comparison.,1

Nkla is a huge risk for sure but reward is great IF Nkla succeeds. But since you know it all and you know how heavy my bags are; would you like to make some easy money? Lets bet like we all do when we buy stocks. You put $500k that my bags are over $10 as you state and i shall do the same that my bags are below $2.50. Should be easiest money you ever made since you claim that you know how heavy my bags are. Would be a nice present for new year. Happy New Year,1

And Twitter was; and still is; a great place for discourse if you stay away from the news and politics. Psychopharmacology Twitter is a great little academic corner; as are many others. I’ve published a paper with a couple other researchers based on a discussion that got kicked off on the bird app. Was recently offered an unexpected but very interesting project based upon my involvement with Chem and bio warfare Twitter (yes; that’s a thing and includes active discussions from academics; members of the military and federal law enforcement.)   Twitter has been an excellent and important tool for connecting across multidisciplinary fields with others who work on relevant projects with similar levels of knowledge. This is not just my opinion; but quite widespread among those who use it. There’s nothing out there that replicates it.  I am sure some people (probably you; for instance) would characterize Twitter being used in this way as elitism… and you think that you’re not given a fair voice. On many topics. As it happens; quite often the folks saying they were pushed out; were pushed out because they had nothing interesting or useful to add to the discussion. *You* aren’t excluded but you stupid takes on Ivermectin and COVID absolutely were.   But instead of coming back having done some research and learned something; a certain aspect of the right wing comes back a screams “no fair! This isn’t fair place for discourse. It’s all a conspiracy and that explains why my ideas aren’t being taken seriously by *actual* experts”  Sorry; Snowflake.,-1

If you ever want to grow up; try real sex. Porn is the only reason new generational men are weak. I believe Andrew tate is the son a bitch to fix it all after all when did women run the country? The answer is never; I believe it's way easier to accept that men are far superior regardless of how hard you work; most women don't even want to do the jobs men do; believe it or not there was a study done in 2012  where this women changed her gender. The result was her killing herself after seeing how men were treated. Why do u think the queen on the chess board gets to go anywhere? The difference between men and women is simple; while the man has to work his entire life to build a career; the women can just come and go as they like and that's the problem with modern day society.,-5

j2eida1,t5_2th52,t3_y90m9y,wallstreetbets,ChudChudington2nd,1672509029,“Housing will not go down. The fed could make interest rates 20% and prices still won’t come down. People who have overpriced houses will just refuse to sell at a loss and will live in their house instead of buying a new one. Regular deaths and people moving do not affect the market much. Most home buyers already own a home that was refinanced at a sub 3% rate; most are not going sell their current place to buy an even more expensive home at 6%. Inventory is also really fucking low. All the higher rates do is freeze the market; they will have very little impact on prices. The only reason housing crashed in ‘07 was that everyone had ARMs so their own payments skyrocketed as rates increased which led to foreclosures and forced selling. These days everyone has a locked in mortgage that will never become more expensive; and there is zero incentive to sell. My current house has a 1900 PITI payment at a 2.25% 30 year fixed mortgage but it would rent out for $2800. I will never sell it due to how cheap my borrowing costs are; I will keep it and rent it out if I ever move to a bigger place. NOBODY is going to voluntarily sell if they are underwater on their current house; this alone keeps prices high. We need forced selling to actually cause a housing crash; and this will only be possible if there is massive unemployment to the point where nobody is in a position to buy or can get loans.   This is the catch 22 of trying to time a housing crash; if you are feeling secure enough in your career to commit to a mortgage; chances are everyone else is feeling good too; thus leading to higher demand and prices. If you are feeling insecure in your job and afraid of getting fired or laid off; everyone else will be afraid too and housing might actually dump. You have to wait until everyone including yourself is too afraid to buy and there is blood in the streets.”,1

You; a living; breathing; semi-conscious human being; sat at your computer and made an effort to search through my comments to find out what I think about Elon Musk so you could better form an argument about why me disliking him is illegitimate.   It's not about how quickly you're able to search it. It's about the fact that you choose to take the time to do that. Ask yourself if that's something you'd take the time to do about a subject or a person that you don't care about or actively dislike.   You played defense for him when his physical appearance was commented on; and getting called out on that makes you act unhinged enough to need to manually verify the opinions of anonymous online strangers in regards to Elon fucking Musk lmao.   Have the day you deserve; weirdo.",8

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes; reposts from the front page; or boomer memes.  Yes; this can be a little subjective at times; but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!  If you need some guidance; don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!  A few tips though!  * Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait; you guys are searching for free?)  * Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment; no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.  * Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online; how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside; we don't want to beat a joke to death; so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.,1

j2en4s6,t5_2th52,t3_zzt3e2,wallstreetbets,jaja94s,1672510924,So tired of this headline. SP dropped 20% to levels not seen since… 2021. 2020 levels for the QQQ’s. When the markets dropped 20%+ in prior market crashes; it set the markets back multiple years. This year’s 20% drop was measured from an all time high that was set at the height of a hyper inflated market (I’ll stop short of calling it a bubble).  The fixation on the YTD drop of 20% by the media seems like an attempt to assuage investors and make investors believe that the market has corrected. Not saying it is or isn’t a good time to invest; but I’m always skeptical of whatever narrative the media is trying to push.  I made a killing shorting through the supposed Xmas rally. Just think about how many media outlets were wrong on that call. Oh; and they also got it wrong every time they pushed the narrative that the fed would pivot. Leading up to every single FOMC meeting.   Edit: rewording,26

j2enshb,t5_2th52,t1_j2elroj,wallstreetbets,NobodyGotTimeFuhDat,1672511189,I’m an advanced STEM public school teacher and my district pays nearly 100% of my medical; dental and vision healthcare costs. I pay less than $10/month in total to receive all three; have excellent coverages; and can see a specialist pretty much whenever I want without virtually zero wait time.  I prefer private insurance (I select my plan and private insurer) over a public healthcare option.  Your NHS is overwhelmed and not doing well.  “An estimated 117;000 patients died last year waiting for care on the NHS; figures have revealed.”  https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/117-000-die-nhs-waiting-lists-covid-backlog-b1010262.html  “Emergency care issues in England contributed to 200 deaths last week; says medical chief”  https://theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/01/emergency-care-england-death-waits-ambulances  “More patients than ever are waiting for treatment (7 million+)  The backlog in secondary care consists of the care that the NHS would normally have delivered but which was disrupted as COVID-19 impacted service delivery. This includes:  - patients on a waiting list for treatment who would ordinarily have been seen by now  - patients who have not yet presented to their GP to seek a referral for symptoms due to concerns of burdening the health service or fears around COVID-19 infection - patients who have had procedures cancelled - patients who have had referrals delayed or cancelled - patients who have had referrals refused due to a lack of capacity. - It will take years to clear the backlog. The ongoing need for stringent infection prevention control measures and workforce shortages mean it will take even longer to work through as demand continues to rise.”  https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/nhs-delivery-and-workforce/pressures/nhs-backlog-data-analysis  “The number of patients having to wait in ambulances outside hospitals in England for more than an hour to be admitted has risen to around 11;000 a week; the highest since records began in 2010; it has been revealed; prompting fears that this is contributing to excess deaths.  An analysis of NHS England data carried out by BBC News found that by late November thousands of ambulances were waiting this long every week—equivalent to about one in seven of all arrivals—because of overcrowding inside hospitals. This was despite the expectation that handover should take around 15 minutes.”  https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj.o2911  “Almost 700;000 people have waited more than 12 hours in AE in the first seven months of 2022; according to leaked NHS data.”  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/a-e-hosptial-trolley-waits-patient-deaths-b2135801.html,1

My issue is cutting things when I'm losing; and taking too big of a position when I get emotional. But there's professional traders with a 40-60% win rate that make millions; because they know when to cut and when to hold. Like; this article says macd is a 90% win rate.  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119204428.ch4  But I wouldn't just use macd because with options; time is important. Even if you're right; if it's too slow; you can lose money.,11

Never said he SHOULD pay that much. Just saying it's completely reasonable that he COULD very easily owe this.  You can't just shit ""business"" expenses for fun. If you're working a W2 job; and your additional earnings are 100% capital gains; what exactly do you suggest he claims is his business? A Schedule C or an 1120S with huge losses with no income are certainly going to draw IRS eyes; especially with the new agents they are hiring and then backlash they are about to experience from this Trump fiasco.  Of course tax planning takes place all year. Doesn't change the fact that if he hit a big yolo trade in November; there was no income to plan for during the year. The fact he had $30k in withholdings/estimated payments and a tax liability of $90k gives me some hints as to how things may have happened as well.  However; the fact that you say ""idk if he is married"" when it's clear as day based on his deduction being that of a married individual; tells me everything I need to know about how much you actually know on this subject vs. how much you think you know and run your mouth on the internet about 😂  I'm going to walk away from this conversation now. You have some grand ideas and possibilities; but in practice they are likely not practical. Unfortunately you're not quite educated enough on the topic to realize this; so you'll continue to blabber and call people who work this stuff all day; everyday ""exhausting""  Happy New Year",0

If that wasn't enough to at least make you curious; there are REAMS of pretty heinous evidence on twitter right now that should convince any reasonable human that there was indeed criminal interference - but...as we've seen here; we're not all reasonable humans; are we?  Despite what you may think; I don't 'hate' you or even dislike you slightly due to your political ideals. I don't know you - and I'm thankful that you engaged in discussion with me as much as you did. So you have a good day and a Happy New Year. God Bless.,1

If you cashed every asset; stock; and IP; you wouldn't have enough real money in the world at their valuations.  So it's a complete myth. There is no value except what it can sell for; and nothing can be liquidated at the same time because the real value would show us it's all an absurdist ponzi scheme.  Same with 401k investment. It's fake too. Most new money in 401k portfolios come from automatic purchases. It's a literal ponzi scheme; just wait until people actively use those accounts for actual retirement - more sales at once will tank share prices; revealing that it was always too high from auto purchases by every employer on that index.  We're fucked boys; hope you're doordashing boba tea while your money is crisp... Soup is on the menu for the rest of our lives coming soon.  Edit: and they work real hard to convince you that selling 401k early is a huge mistake and a disaster... My dude's; it's literally just taxed like normal income like it would have been anyway as a paycheck. Don't eat their bullshit.,15

For example; you have a VQ of 47% that’s a pretty risky hold so you’re going to want to allow for greater market fluctuations and not stop you out during one or two turbulent days on Wall Street.

When you go to work at SpaceX it’s with the understanding that you probably aren’t going to last for more than a year or two. They will work you as hard as they can and get absolute *maximum* utilization out of you until you burn out and move on. Efficiency and results are the only things that matter. But in exchange; you get to put that on your resume. And if you have SpaceX on your resume; you will get a job anywhere on this planet you want in that field. I know this because I’m an engineering graduate and a couple of my friends ended up going that route.   But back to my original point; Twitter isn’t the same thing. And unless he’s actually *trying* to run that company into the ground; he really needs to stop doing shit like that.,1

I'm confident Tesla will recover all lost market cap over time. Trying to time the market is for noobs. I don't own any Tesla shares though. My money is all in private equity; so I'm used to letting positions sit for many years. Everything is clear in hindsight though. People like to think they can time the market and it often works against them no matter how logical the move seems at the time. Best to just pick a good company and DCA. No need to sell TSLA at $400 if you think it will ultimately go above that.,1

j2ez08u,t5_2th52,t1_j2ee883,wallstreetbets,JTFalo,1672515838,I had written a response that was big beautiful and long; and then reddit glitched and it's all gone :( I'll try to recap in short terms:  MA: I set up my MAs to be 50/200. These are moving averages based off the past 50 and 200 days. If 50 (I colored gold) is on top; party don't stop (overall uptrend). If 200 (blue) is on top; shit is about to drop (downtrend).  I look at this first to see if I'm going with the trend (likely); unless I see signs of reversal (W; doji; RSI; EMA cross).  So now that I know the overall trend of the map; I'm looking at my EMAs. Same rule applies; but the numbers are 13; 21; 35. Why those numbers? Idk; I saw them online. 9 and 20 work too. 8 and 13 can be used. Just need a bigger and a smaller number. In my chart; small is white; big is red. Big on top: drop. Small on top: party don't stop.   Finally; RSI is relative strength index. If there's a small move in either direction; likely to see the opposite happen right after. So if I see <30 or >70; I get out. For macd; if it matches my color; I feel more confident staying in; but if I see a big hill or a big valley; I get out.   This chart goes perfect with the explanation. Of course; it doesn't always look this perfect xD But basically; I just look at colors and do what the colors tell me. Which sounds like horoscope shit; and maybe it is; but someone much smarter than me invented this math and knows the logic behind it. I just know it works.,99

They want to control the user experience down to the most minute detail; leaving the end user being nothing more than an observer who will dress and look exactly what that company wants them to look like.  If you want success; make sure that avatar creation and customization is a feature in your platform. That's step 1. Not talking about a pre-configured avatar that you can tweak slightly; but able to go all in on customization. People want to express themselves; stifling that out of fear that their expression may upset an investor is how shit dies.,1

He doesn’t actually design the rockets. He makes management decisions about what projects the designers should work on.   These aren’t invalid jobs. Companies need management. But Elon Musk isn’t Tony Stark working in his lab to make rocket engines.   Elon Musk is the guy who tells engineers what projects to work on. Which; again; is fine.

j2f5gla,t5_2th52,t3_1001pxn,wallstreetbets,giovannigiannis,1672518614,Personally I don’t think the first 6 months of 2023 will be much better. I think tech will drop another 10-20% in that timeframe.   I mean; the “experts” are still denying that we’re in a recession.  And at some point we know that they will have to admit it.  But they’re only gonna admit it if things get worse.  Put all that together; and yeah; it’s gonna drop at least until March.  Heavy drops next week to start; then probably more slowly (with a few rebounds).   There is really nothing to be optimistic about in 2023.  Maybe just the return-to-work orders that are flooding will provide us all with a sense of normalcy; and that would be good for overall market sentiments.   The biggest ticket in optimism would be if the war ended.  God I pray that happens soon (not just for stocks; but for individuals and the world as a whole).   As for inflation; if those numbers keep heading in the correct direction; that too would fill the market with hope; and we’ll have at least 1 short rally.  Anyway; I think I’m ranting because I got the New Year’s blues a little bit.  But it’ll be okay. Happy New Year y’all!    I hope we can all forgive each other and move on with life; lovingly and peacefully.,1

Yeah; that's exactly why he predicts that. He even said the capitulation could be delayed until mid year as well to July. Reason being that vol sellers have completely pushed skew to the zero percentile; and they will continue to do so. Interest rate shocks take a long time to move through the system. Optimism can pick up and we even break out of the downward trendline as it seems that we are indeed getting a soft landing along with fed pause...  Until the unprecedented tightening hike effects finally burst through the pipeline; the shit hits the fan; and we enter a depression. Crash.,2

Lists to follow individual options just like as if they were stocks 3. weekly and lifetime graphs for individual options 4. real time profit/liss graphs for individual irons as well as for complex spreads that predict your profit/liss and your breakeven prices; including for complex multi-leg spreads; eliminating the need to use options profit calculator 5. real time alarms for individual options prices  fidelity's Vegas interface tries to emulate some basic ducting if robinhood but fails spectacularly; to the point that the shitty old interface is actually more usable,2

I had made like $30k trading doing the same strategy I did this year; doing an hour a day a couple times a week; so I thought ""oh man; if I could do this full time; I could be a millionaire.""  NOPE.  I apparently trade way better and less emotional when I'm working full time. You'd think I'd be more responsible when it's the money I need to live off of; but those emotions; the ""I need this win"" totally fucked my trading up. I would be begging and crying to the computer. Right now; I have customers so I'm like ""hey I need to get out of this before my next appointment shows up; and I cannot let a trade fuck up my day so bad that I can't sell."" So that helps me take smaller positions and not get greedy/not let things get too bad.",16

In other words; just because a portfolio has done well in the past doesn't mean it will continue to do so in the future. There are many factors that can affect investment returns; and even seemingly small changes can have a big impact over time. So while your portfolio may have had great historical returns; there's no guarantee that it will perform as well going forward.,5

j2f90bn,t5_2th52,t3_1003gpr,wallstreetbets,VisualMod,1672520172,>There are a few reasons for this. First; the overall market capitalization of US; Canadian; and European markets is much higher than that of Asian markets. This means that there is more money flowing into these markets; which drives up trading activity and prices. Second; the regulatory environment in US; Canada; and Europe is generally more stringent than in Asia. This results in higher costs for brokers operating in these markets. Finally; distance also plays a role – it costs more to trade stocks from another continent than from within North America or Europe,2

I've turned a few like $500-2000 accounts into $5k+ in a few months... and then YOLOd in options and got wrecked. So the issue is knowing when to cut. I don't invest anything except what's in my 401k... which is not doing well right now. I know swing trading is less stressful and I recommend it. And I should probably do it. My plan for 2023 is to use my profits to by 100 shares of something I believe in (V) and then sell covered calls and puts on it. Trade with the little bit left. That way I have income coming in each week; and I can't overtrade since part of my money is in use.,4

j2fb780,t5_2th52,t1_j2d5sww,wallstreetbets,SomberTom,1672521146,Hey! I noticed you used an emoji.  I don’t know if you’re new here; so I’ll let you off the hook this time. Using emojis is frowned upon here on this great site; and for good reason. Instagram normies often use them; and you don’t want to be a normie; do you?  If I catch you using an emoji in the future; I’ll be forced to issue a downvote to your comment. Why should you care; you may ask? Well to begin; you will lose karma on your account; which is a useful social status tool and also a way to show others you know your way around Reddit.  If you were to continue the use of emojis; I would be forced to privately message you about your slip-up. Any further offenses past that would leave me no other option than to report your account. I don’t think I have to explain why you don’t want that.  But anyways; no harm done yet! Follow these simple rules and you’ll enjoy your future on Reddit! Have a blessed (and hopefully emoji-free) day; stranger.,-28

Is that sexism? When a threat comes along; women call men to risk their lives protecting theirs. Is that sexism? All men should to die for a woman to live?   Should we start making women do their fair share and working the sewers; garbage collecting; and brick layer jobs? Should we make them protect themselves when a dude is about to pounce on them? No; of course not; and that's why I know you're full of shit as well as they are.  They sit in their comfy ass cubicles; complaining about air conditioning; and being ungrateful children about the sacrifices made on their behalf on a daily basis. The ones that even do try to do it themselves; get manhandled. Female police officers can't even restrain a moderately built man.   Is that sexism? I think it may be sexism. That's also reality. Reality discriminated us into roles. And that's what he's talking about. Men can't pump out kids. Women can. Women cannot build societies. Men can. We have roles and no other mammal on this planet struggles with this basic setup other than us for some reason.,1

Fed will have to turn the printer back on eventually; and given the time lag that the 2020/2021 stimulus took to get inflation up; I’m thinking that’s equally the lag time for rate hikes to slam inflation down to record lows.   So by August next year inflation should be well on its way down the shitter and fed might start thinking about maybe they overdid it; prolly start saying shit like deflation is transitory; remember that narrative?  Well by winter 2023; I’m expecting Fed to be well into easing and the dems will be handing out stimmies again especially with the elections coming up the next year   Maybe China reopening might abate deflation somewhat but not to the point where it’ll help avoid the need for economic stimulus.

We could settle in at the 1stdev line for a decade or we could see more volatility. In the 60s the 2stdev line is tapped several times in a row over a decade so we could go back up to that next year if history is a guide (but it isn't).  If it weren't for the long period of high inflation and crap asset prices in the 70s then the historical trend would be much higher.  And why does the exponential trend line make sense? Is there an actual reason for it or did we just add that because it happens to fit the chart? Does it feel right to you to call something a ""historical trend line"" when the market spends almost zero time actually on that line?  If this chart has any value at all; it suggests to me that the market likes to be between 0 and +2stdev. It's an exceptional time when it's below 0. In the 80s assets were stupid cheap which is why boomers all got rich when the market corrected.",23

On a log scale with average growth and vs inflation; the SP isn't quite so sure about its overvaluedness but maybe that's because the SP isn't quite the metric of GDP that it once was? Difficult to say  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/S%26P_500_Index_Logarithmic_Chart_through_Jan_2021.svg  You can see the GDP decoupling right there; so the question is is the SP just a worse indicator for GDP or is it horribly overvalued or do I have no idea how to read this thing? All three? Well happy new year  Together with [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di4kH5InHrQ); and I have to say he is my kind of special; you can try to gather some understanding of what is happening.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes; reposts from the front page; or boomer memes.  Yes; this can be a little subjective at times; but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!  If you need some guidance; don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!  A few tips though!  * Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait; you guys are searching for free?)  * Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment; no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.  * Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online; how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside; we don't want to beat a joke to death; so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.,1

j2fijfj,t5_2th52,t1_j25kz9x,wallstreetbets,Sarfbot,1672524364,I don’t disagree that OPs list is useless. You also brought up good points which I mostly agree with.  1) One callout is that Alexa was a $6B+ cost losing business. They’ve cut down Alexa and devices investments completely.  2) The pendulum of “growth vs cost efficiency” has fully swung towards efficiency now. With Andy’s recent email confirming cost cutting and layoffs in Q1 and possibly throughout the year; Amazon will be profitable. No doubt in my mind.   As large as Amazon is; I truly don’t know a more nimble tech company. When pressures to increase minimum wage rose; they made the decision literally over the weekend to raise their minimum wage to $15/hr. Friday the motion was discussed; Monday it was announced and the following week it was instated. For reference; Target and Disney committed to the same goal but said they’ll need 1-2+ years to implement this.   Another reference is the year before pandemic. They had pivoted to cost cutting and increased their EPS to $14/share; from negative EPS six quarters straight.,1

j2flzvw,t5_2th52,t1_j2fk8au,wallstreetbets,Year3030,1672525891,"Ok OP in all seriousness I've got the answer for you. Dump her ass; she won't be faithful. The reality of relationships between men and women are touchy subjects I won't use any trigger words. In general though unless you are dominating her; look like Ryan Gosling or make her laugh uncontrollably I'm guessing you are providing for her in one way or more; possibly a nice guy. If you are in the latter and she looks better than you do then she is using you and technically you are a beta. If that's the case she will continue to stay with you while seeking an alpha; and she may stay with you after she finds an alpha because you provide security and you won't change but she will continue to see the alpha. This is nature; pure and simple.   My advice is if you want; stay with her; make sure she isn't sucking dick behind your back. If you think she is or have proof dump her ass and move on.   Ask yourself what you want in a relationship. If you want to be an alpha then you need to figure out how to be one. There is plenty of advice out there I won't recap it. If you become an alpha; you will have your pick of women and this one won't matter as much unless you have a special connection (don't fool yourself though into thinking you have one).   All I'm saying is don't go in with eyes closed relying on your feelings of ""love"" or that she's perfect. It's a trap.   I speak from experience; just don't pull the wool over your own eyes.   And if you need a reality check; your specific situation is a little messed up. I would not consider her friends whose dicks she sucked your friends.",2

If the data were clustered around a certain line with just a few outliers farther from that line; you could remove a handful of data points and not affect the midpoint. This is almost the opposite of that. The only time the market was at that ""trend"" line for more than a brief moment was the mid 2000s. I could draw a trendline through a Jackson Pollock painting with just as much relevance as the one on this graph.  (p.s. Buffet has disavowed this indicator; but it still bears his name)",3

I’m not sure the specifics on O.J. but grains are traded in 5000 bushel contracts. A tick is 1/4 cents so its$12.50 a tick on grains.  https://preview.redd.it/r754k713oc9a1.png?width=1170format=pngauto=webps=95c58e4986c13c4cf1f6cacefbba5add473a92f3  this is the contract specs for O.J.  if you think the price will get lower you sell and visa versa for rising prices. I don’t know how much margin is for O.J.  But for a contract of Soybeans it’s about $3500; if the market move against you then you are on the hook to keep your account margined up to $3500 if you want to hang on. Obviously if your position moves in your direction you can pocket the excess.,8

It’s not pointing out that over the Buffet Line is bad and under is good. It’s showing that 2 standard deviations is where you should be taking profit and waiting.  You can even see that there’s been a few rallies at 1 standard deviation (or lower) before it goes back down.  I would actually argue that if you go half cash before it hits the 2std line and starts crashing; you should start nibbling a bit at 1std over the line; buy more at the line; and go all in at -1std.,1

j2fpqy9,t5_2th52,t1_j2dfu1w,wallstreetbets,corridomygalidci28,1672527578,"They did donate to both parties. 40mil and 20 mil is only what we know. He also made donations via dark money. And FTX also made corporate donations under other people names which is illegal and one of his criminal charges included in his indictment. His indictment is stating that they were trying to buy support from both parties and influence illegally.  Binance did not rug pull him. The Alameda/FTX balance sheet was leaked showing how their balance sheet is filled with illiquid garbage; his own printed out of thin air tokens. Whales have started to liquidate then already after that leaked Balance sheet. So; CZ said he will liquidate his bag as he does not want to lose billions like he did with LUNA. And he also mentioned that he will not support someone who is lobbying against him. I wouldn't either. I would liquidate my bag immediately and would tell SBF to f off. Don't blame him at all. CZ ended up holding a bag as he didn't liquidate all of it. SBF called him and begged him to stop selling. So CZ ended up with the bag of worthless crap.  (By the way; FTX was caught trying to manipulate features on Binance years ago- supposedly that is how bad blood has started between them; but then they worked it out and it was fine and Binance invested in FTX; but SBF kept trying to push him out and used politics as his weapon to try to destroy him as a competition)  So after the leaked Balance Sheet and CZ tweet; the fear kicked in; customers started to withdraw; but SBF misused customers assets to bail out Alameda and on risky bets; etc so he didn't have all customers funds to let them to withdraw. FTX was supposed to be a custodian for customers assets and he was supposed to keep all user assets backed 1:1 at all times. He didn't. He committed embezzlement and what is against own FTXs terms of service. That is why the FXT collapse. There is no excuse. All user funds must be kept 1:1 at all times since FTX was a custodian. If he did that; none of that would have happened.  Allegedly; FTX customer funds were used for loans to executives; risky trading by Alameda Research; political donations; and lavish spending on everything from beachfront homes to private jet flights.  The charges listed against SBF in the indictment are conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers; wire fraud on customers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders; wire fraud on lenders; conspiracy to commit commodities fraud; conspiracy to commit securities fraud; conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States and violate the campaign finance laws.  He defrauded lenders as well. They were providing misleading and False information to lenders hiding the extend of Alameda borrowing. And Ellison; acting on Bankman-Fried’s orders; borrowed billions of dollars from lenders; according to the SEC suit. Those loans were backed in significant part by their own token; which was issued by FTX and given to Alameda for free. Ellison’s job was to buy FTX tokens on various platforms in order to increase the price; thus making the FTX token that was collateral against Alameda’s loans more valuable. That; in turn; made it possible for Alameda to borrow even more. When shit hit the fan; the FTX token crashed. So the collateral for all those loans became worthless.  Alameda also had ""special privilege"" to trade on FTX which was not disclosed to all customers and investors and that was set up by Wang who also pled guilty already. Ellison already pled guilty as well and they both turned on SBF and cooperating with feds to get lesser sentencing. They are facing 115 and 50 years.",2

Teslas insurance is about 1500$. So that gives 4.5b; not less than 1.5b total revenue if all cars were to be insured in tesla ins. Im not sure where you got the 80m gross profit; since tesla doesnt do marketing and basically has inhouse eveything; has the best and safest ( in terms of profitability because they know their customers; thus have the best info on whether someone will crash or not ) insurance policy offered for their cars; profit will likely be north of 700m.  Even with your shitty eval; a business doing 80m gross profit is worth 1.5b (LOL); this puts tesla insurance in 15b accounting value. If you include all other value boosts like future proofness; growth factor; home insurance; basically no competition and a whole package to be offered to investors; tesla insurance can and certainly will be valued at north of 100b ONE DAY. Not tomorrow; one day.,1

In a truly free market; third parties cannot legitimately control or attempt to control a first party’s actions. That means all parties subject to public policy would need to consent to said policy (or the legitimacy of the governing organization).   I think that the assumption that all actors in the market have consented to government intervention (public policy) is invalid; due to the reasoning in Lysander Spooner’s essay linked [here](http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/bright/Spooner/Spooner_1483_Bk.pdf).,1

Anyway; if they wished to fight price inflation then they'd move fed funds to a rate above price inflation and stop screwing around with silly 25 - 75 bp hikes.   Even at 425 to 450 bp on fed funds; which took nearly a year to get to btw; there's zero chance they'll get a handle on price inflation. Instead they're simply normalizing high levels of price inflation while slowing destroying debt and equity markets. Here I thought the fed always aimed for 2% price inflation to steal slowly from savers...now 2% has turned into 7% and people are happy when it stops going up for a couple months. lol,0

j2fsumw,t5_2th52,t1_j2fbni0,wallstreetbets,wonkagloop,1672529044,I like to swing trade of off trends. My ideal contracts are 2-4 weeks DTE and always in the macro direction of a trend (Daily; Weekly even) in SPX contracts. I’ll get overall market sentiment day by day and trade only off of volume and price action. If I’m bearish; I’ll wait until overall volume Net Flow favors the downside because that establishes the trend. As the trend plays out; I close the moment I see a volume bar close that contradicts my trend. I won’t close if the price action moves up; I’m closing once the price is closed for that timeframe and the volume of that candle decides positioning. Sometimes I’ll swing using just that Daily chart; but I have also managed positions in 2H; 1H; and 15m because of trends ending or periods of consolidation beginning.   Overall Net Flow swapping either side decides my direction and openings; especially shortly after Net Flow favoring my side. Volume is my follow through and ultimate que to sell. Instead of candles I like Heiken Ashi because it keeps confidence in moving with the overall trend as the price action reflects an overall moving average either upside or downside as bars.  I like what you said *”the colors tell me what to do”*. That’s all it is; literally. Price action is one of the last things I see when checking on positioning. Volume volume volume.,3

ML training workloads increase in their size every year as the industry cranks out ever better models. I firmly disagree on companies cutting their ML development in a deteriorating environment; for many companies; strong ML IS the economic future of their company.   NVDA stays high because as much as things could possibly deteriorate in the short term; in the mid to long term; NVDA makes one of the most critical products for the advancement of technology. When it dips; people will buy it; and at some point; we’re going to get a bullish tech market again and the shares will achieve an even greater premium. Their growth prospects in the ~10 year span are better than most mega cap companies; yet they are also one of the safest growth investments out there.   No doubt; you might make money playing NVDA; but I would watch out how long you’re short.,3

j2fwj4r,t5_2th52,t1_j2es7qz,wallstreetbets,the_glutton17,1672530694,"It wouldn't drive the price down from a ""confidence"" point of view (a little bit though); it would drive the price down because millions of shares were suddenly up for sale (with no buyers).    Selling shares is what makes prices go down.  Edit: aren't you all ""apes"" now and brag to your friend about how you ""trade stocks""?",1
j2fwk18,t5_2th52,t1_j2fw9en,wallstreetbets,Zachincool,1672530705,Here let me copy paste directly from the internet to make it more clear for you:  *International Sales*   *A second fair criticism of the Buffett Indicator is that the stock market valuation reflects international activity while GDP does not. Though GDP does include national exports; it would not include something like the sales Amazon makes in Italy (sourced from Italian fulfillment centers). However; Amazon's Italian business is certainly priced into its overall stock price; which is listed in the US. This would therefore drive a higher Buffett Indicator value; since the numerator (total stock market value) is going up; while the denominator (GDP) is unaffected. As globalization has expanded steadily over the last 50 years; this should be a key driver in the growth of the indicator over time. Additionally; this would make the Buffett Indicator value for other (smaller; non-USA countries) even more volatile; as a smaller stock market is likely to be dominated by large international firms.*   *This is a very fair criticism of the Buffett Indicator itself -- though not necessarily for the valuation model presented here; which looks at the Buffett Indicator relative to it's own exponentially growing trend line. Look again at the Buffett Indicator from Figure 3...:*,1

j2fww0z,t5_2th52,t3_1003fc1,wallstreetbets,Benry26,1672530854,The line is clearly following a new trend line starting in mid-2009 when MJ died (representing the True death of the 20th century/the “old world” culture) and the new; optimistic; youthful party-pop music culture/style that would mostly define the entire 2010s exploded; and if you follow the bottom line of that; it indicates the bottom is close to in or already in. COVID has mostly blown over now (we’re not going back to masks) and we’ve corrected to where things were before at the end of last decade (c. 2018/2019 levels). Crypto and the stock market are also closely tied now; and the next Bitcoin halving is fast approaching; and that’s when valuation trends higher. I expect stocks to follow suit; citing how closely the two moved together in last year’s bull market; they’re kind of in the same boat now. 1950-1990 logic simply doesn’t apply to the 2020s; it’s a different world with bullish technology and rapid globalization.

j2fxcfs,t5_2th52,t1_j2fwbou,wallstreetbets,JTFalo,1672531057,I meant like; the color patterns. This is the most non-answer ever but there is a golden cross; so long term it could bounce up; but short term; if it breaks here (looking at EMAs) it could drop. If it does drop; I'd consider buying at $185 because it looks like it could form an inverse head and shoulders. I'd consider buying here where it's at; especially if this becomes support. If it breaks support (below 205); I'd sell; jump back in at $185. But if it keeps support; and it breaks past $225; I would see if it can hit 235 and then 250.  https://preview.redd.it/2drs7gdj5d9a1.jpeg?width=1080format=pjpgauto=webps=e31442f5989f0773002bda7379a27a7c0a3fc4fe,1
